The enzyme functions in meta-cleavage pathways of aromatic hydrocarbon catabolism. Because several Arg residues located near the active site in the crystal structure of Pseudomonas putida are not conserved among all members of this family, because the literature describes a general role in the isomerization of beta,gamma-unsaturated enones to their alpha,beta-isomers, and because of the presence of fairly distantly related paralogs in Campylobacter jejuni, the family is regarded as not necessarily uniform in function.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this nearly universal bacterial protein family are regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) proteases. Older and synonymous gene symbols include yaeL in E. coli, mmpA in Caulobacter crescentus, etc. This family includes a region that hits the PDZ domain, found in a number of proteins targeted to the membrane by binding to a peptide ligand. The N-terminal region of this family contains a perfectly conserved motif HEXGH as found in a number of metalloproteinases, where the Glu is the active site and the His residues coordinate the metal cation.
CC  Membership in this family is determined by an HMM built to force a match to the full length of the seed alignment. A model that detects fragments as well matches a number of members of the PEPTIDASE FAMILY S2C. The region of match appears not to overlap the active site domain.

CC  This model describes the SsrA-binding protein, also called tmRNA binding protein, small protein B, and SmpB. The small, stable RNA SsrA (also called tmRNA or 10Sa RNA) recognizes stalled ribosomes such as occur during translation from message that lacks a stop codon. It becomes charged with Ala like a tRNA, then acts as mRNA to resume translation started with the defective mRNA. The short C-terminal peptide tag added by the SsrA system marks the abortively translated protein for degradation. SmpB binds SsrA after its aminoacylation but before the coupling of the Ala to the nascent polypeptide chain and is an essential part of the SsrA peptide tagging system. SmpB has been associated with the survival of bacterial pathogens in conditions of stress. It is universal in the first 100 sequenced bacterial genomes.

CC  This protein family originally was named SurE because of its role in stationary phase survivalin Escherichia coli. In E. coli, surE is next to pcm, an L-isoaspartyl protein repair methyltransferase that is also required for stationary phase survival. Recent work (PMID:15489502) shows that viewing SurE as an acid phosphatase (3.1.3.2) is not accurate. Rather, SurE in E. coli, Thermotoga maritima, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum acts strictly on nucleoside 5'- and 3'-monophosphates.

CC  This subfamily contains the tRNA-i(6)A37 modification enzyme, MiaB (TIGR01574).  The phylogenetic tree indicates 4 distinct clades, one of which corresponds to MiaB.  The other three clades are modelled by hypothetical equivalogs (TIGR01125, TIGR01579 and TIGR01578).  Together, the four models hit every sequence hit by the subfamily model without any overlap between them.
CC  This subfamily is aparrently a part of a larger superfamily of enzymes utilizing both a 4Fe4S cluster and S-adenosyl methionine  (SAM) to initiate radical reactions.  MiaB acts on a particular isoprenylated Adenine base of certain tRNAs causing thiolation at an aromatic carbon, and probably also transferring a methyl grouyp from SAM to the thiol.  The particular substrate of the three other clades is unknown but may be very closely related.

CC  This model describes a widely distributed family of bacterial proteins related to iojap from plants. It includes RsfS(YbeB) from E. coli. The gene iojap is a pattern-striping gene in maize, reflecting a chloroplast development defect in some cells. The conserved function of this protein is to silence ribosomes by binding the ribosomal large subunit and impairing joining with the small subunit in response to nutrient stress. Note that RsfS (starvation) is an author-endorsed change from the published symbol RsfA, which conflicted with previously published gene symbols.

CC  This subfamily of sequences falls within the Class-IIB subfamily (TIGR01484) of the Haloacid Dehalogenase superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The use of the name "Cof" as an identifier here is arbitrary and refers to the E. coli Cof protein.
CC  This subfamily is notable for the large number of recent paralogs in many species.  Listeria, for instance, has 12, Clostridium, Lactococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have 8 each, Enterococcus and Salmonella have 7 each, and Bacillus subtilus, Mycoplasma, Staphylococcus and E. coli have 6 each.  This high degree of gene duplication is limited to the gamma proteobacteria and low-GC gram positive lineages.  The profusion of genes in this subfamily is not coupled with a high degree of divergence, so it is impossible to determine an accurate phylogeny at the equivalog level.
CC  Considering the relationship of this subfamily to the other known members of the HAD-IIB subfamily (TIGR01484), sucrose and trehalose phosphatases and phosphomannomutase, it seems a reasonable hypothesis that these enzymes act on phosphorylated sugars.  Possibly the diversification of genes in this subfamily represents the diverse sugars and polysaccharides that various bacteria find in their biological niches.
CC  The members of this subfamily are restricted almost exclusively to bacteria (one sequences from S. pombe scores above trusted, while another is between trusted and noise).  It is notable that no archaea are found in this group, the closest relations to the archaea found here being two Deinococcus sequences.

CC  This model describes the Drosophila protein Pelota, the budding yeast protein DOM34 which it can replace, and a set of closely related archaeal proteins. Members contain a proposed RNA binding motif. The meiotic defect in pelota mutants may be a complex result of a protein translation defect, as suggested in yeast by ribosomal protein RPS30A being a multicopy suppressor and by an altered polyribosome profile in DOM34 mutants rescued by RPS30A. This family is homologous to a family of peptide chain release factors. Pelota is proposed to act in protein translation.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  In many species, Gln--tRNA ligase is missing. tRNA(Gln) is misacylated with Glu after which a heterotrimeric amidotransferase converts Glu to Gln. This HMM represents the amidase chain of that heterotrimer, encoded by the gatA gene.
CC  In the Archaea, Asn--tRNA ligase is also missing. This amidase subunit may also function in the conversion of Asp-tRNA(Asn) to Asn-tRNA(Asn), presumably with a different recognition unit to replace gatB. Both Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum have both authentic gatB and a gatB-related gene, but only one gene like gatA.
CC  It has been shown that gatA can be expressed only when gatC is also expressed. In most species expressing the amidotransferase, the gatC ortholog is about 90 residues in length, but in Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae the gatC equivalent is as the C-terminal domain of a much longer protein. Not surprisingly, the Mycoplasmas also represent the most atypical lineage of gatA orthology.
CC  This orthology group is more narrowly defined here than in Proc Natl Acad Aci USA 94, 11819-11826 (1997). In particular, a Rhodococcus homolog found in association with nitrile hydratase genes and described as an enantiomer-selective amidase active on several 2-aryl propionamides, is excluded here. It is likely, however, that the amidase subunit GatA is not exclusively a part of the Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase heterotrimer and restricted to that function in all species.

CC  The heterotrimer GatABC is responsible for transferring the NH2 group that converts Glu to Gln, or Asp to Asn after the Glu or Asp has been ligated to the tRNA for Gln or Asn, respectively. In Lactobacillus, GatABC is responsible only for tRNA(Gln). In the Archaea, GatABC is responsible only for tRNA(Asn), while GatDE is responsible for tRNA(Gln). In lineages that include Thermus, Chlamydia, or Acidithiobacillus, the GatABC complex catalyzes both.

CC  This peptide is found only in the Archaea. It is paralogous to the gatB-encoded subunit of Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase. The GatABC system operates in many bacteria to convert Glu-tRNA(Gln) into Gln-tRNA(Gln). However, the homologous system in archaea instead converts Asp-tRNA(Asn) to Asn-tRNA(Asn). Glu-tRNA(Gln) is converted to Gln-tRNA(Gln) by a heterodimeric amidotransferase of GatE (this protein) and GatD.
CC  The Archaea have an Asp-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase instead of an Asp--tRNA ligase, but the genes have not been identified. It is likely that this protein replaces gatB in Asp-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase but that both enzymes share gatA.

CC  Archaea, organelles, and many bacteria charge Gln-tRNA by first misacylating it with Glu and then amidating Glu to Gln. This small protein is part of the amidotransferase heterotrimer and appears to be important to the stability of the amidase subunit encode by gatA, but its function may not be required in every organism that expresses gatA and gatB.
CC  The seed alignment for this HMM does not include any eukaryotic sequence and is not guaranteed to find eukaryotic examples, although it does find some. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which expresses the amidotransferase for mitochondrial protein translation, seems to lack a gatC ortholog.
CC  This HMM has been revised to remove the candidate sequence from Methanococcus jannaschii, now part of a related model.

CC  Members of this protein were designated YjeQ and are now designated RsgA (ribosome small subunit-dependent GTPase A).
CC  The strongest motif in the alignment of these proteins is GXSGVGKS[ST], a classic P-loop for nucleotide binding. This protein has been shown to cleave GTP and remain bound to GDP. A role as a regulator of translation has been suggested.
CC  The Aquifex aeolicus ortholog is split into consecutive open reading frames. Consequently, this model was build in fragment mode (-f option).

CC  Methylglyoxal synthase (MGS) generates methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic metabolite (that may also be a regulatory metabolite and) that is detoxified, prinicipally, through a pathway involving glutathione and glyoxylase I. Totemeyer, et al. (MUID:98149311) propose that, during a loss of control over carbon flux, with accumulation of phosphorylated sugars and depletion of phosphate, as might happen during a rapid shift to a richer medium, MGS aids the cell by converting some dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to MG and phosphate. This is therefore an alternative to triosephosphate isomerase and the remainder of the glycolytic pathway for the disposal of DHAP during the stress of a sudden increase in available sugars.

CC  Several NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases, including 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, tartrate dehydrogenase, and the dimeric forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase, share a nucleotide binding domain unrelated to that of lactate dehydrogenase and its homologs. These enzymes dehydrogenate their substates at a H-C-OH site adjacent to a H-C-COOH site; the latter carbon, now adjacent to a carbonyl group, readily decarboxylates.
CC  Among these decarboxylating dehydrogenases of hydroxyacids, overall sequence homology indicates evolutionary history rather than actual substrate or cofactor specifity, which may be toggled experimentally by replacement of just a few amino acids. 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase is an NAD-dependent enzyme and should have a sequence resembling HGSAPDI around residue 340. The subtrate binding loop should include a sequence resembling E[KQR]X(0,1)LLXXR around residue 115. Other contacts of importance are known from crystallography but not detailed here.
CC  This HMM will not find all isopropylmalate dehydrogenases; the enzyme from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 is more similar to mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases than to other known isopropylmalate dehydrogenases and was omitted to improve the specificity of the model. It scores below the cutoff and below some enzymes known not to be isopropylmalate dehydrogenase.

CC  Several NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases, including 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, tartrate dehydrogenase, and the multimeric forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase, share a nucleotide binding domain unrelated to that of lactate dehydrogenase and its homologs. These enzymes dehydrogenate their substates at a H-C-OH site adjacent to a H-C-COOH site; 
CC  Prokaryotic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases resemble their NAD-dependent counterparts and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (an NAD-dependent enzyme) more closely than they resemble eukaryotic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases.

CC  The IspH protein (previously designated LytB) has now been recognized as the last enzyme in the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).
CC  Escherichia coli LytB protein had been found to regulate the activity of RelA (guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate synthetase I), which in turn controls the level of a regulatory metabolite. It is involved in penicillin tolerance and the stringent response.

The member from Streptomyces coelicolor is found upstream in the operon of the class II oxygen-independent ribonucleotide reductase gene nrdJ and was shown to repress nrdJ expression. Many members of this family are found near genes for riboflavin biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting a role in that pathway. However, a phylogenetic profiling study associates members of this family with the presence of a palindromic signal with consensus acaCwAtATaTwGtgt, termed the NrdR-box, an upstream element for most operons for ribonucleotide reductase of all three classes in bacterial genomes.

This protein is encoded next to PabC, 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase, in E. coli and numerous other proteobacteria, but that proximity is not conserved in other lineages. Numerous members of this family have been misannotated as aminodeoxychorismate lyase, apparently because of promiximty to PabC.

It shows weaker similarity, possibly through shared structural constraints rather than through homology, with the amino-terminal domain of elongation factor Ts. Alpha-NAC plays a role in preventing nascent polypeptides from binding inappropriately to membrane-targeting apparatus during translation, but is also active as a transcription regulator.

Annotation of some members of this family as hemolysins appears to represent propagation from an unpublished GenBank submission, L36462, attributed to Aeromonas hydrophila but a close match to E. coli.

CC  Members of this protein family, rich in coiled coil regions,  are molecular chaperones in the class of the prefoldin (GimC) alpha subunit. Prefoldin is a hexamer of two alpha and four beta subunits. This protein appears universal in the archaea but is restricted to Aquifex aeolicus among bacteria so far. Eukaryotes have several related proteins; only prefoldin subunit 5, which appeared the most similar to archaeal prefoldin alpha, is included in this model.
CC  This model finds a set of small proteins from the Archaea and from Aquifex aeolicus that may represent two orthologous groups. The proteins are predicted to be mostly coiled coil, and builds of HMMs for the seed alignment with less selective parameters lead to significant hits to large numbers of proteins that contain coiled coil regions. This model is built with a more selective usage of Dirichlet priors.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  An orthologous protein found once in each of the completed archaeal genomes corresponds to a zinc finger-containing domain repeated as the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the mouse protein ZPR1. ZPR1 is an experimentally proven zinc-binding protein that binds the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); binding is inhibited by EGF stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation by EGF is followed by some redistribution of ZPR1 to the nucleus. By analogy, other proteins with the ZPR1 zinc finger domain may be regulatory proteins that sense protein phosphorylation state and/or participate in signal transduction.
CC  The search program hmmls is suggested to detect repeats of this domain in eukaryotic proteins. However, search with hmmsw may reveal shorter versions of the domain, as in PID:g1165216.

Its presence is confirmed in archaeal genera Pyrococcus (PMID:12761201), Sulfolobus, Halobacterium, and Haloferax (PMID:10648545), but in an older report was not detected in Methanococcus voltae (J Biol Chem 1987 Dec 5;262(34):16585-9).

Separated by a fairly deep branch, although still strongly related, is a small cluster of proteins from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Archeoglobus fulgidus, the latter of which has two.

The modified His, termed diphthamide, is part of translation elongation factor EF-2 and is the site for ADP-ribosylation by diphtheria toxin. This model includes both Dph1 and Dph2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although only Dph2 is found in the Archaea (see TIGR03682). Dph2 has been shown to act analogously to the radical SAM (rSAM) family (PF04055), with 4Fe-4S-assisted cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine to create a free radical, but a different organic radical than in rSAM.

CC  Archaeal members differ substantially from eukaryotic members and should be considered putative pending experimental evidence. The protein is universal and single copy among completed archaeal and eukarotic genomes to date. DNA primase creates RNA primers needed for DNA replication.
CC  This HMM is named putative because the assignment is putative for archaeal proteins. Eukaryotic proteins scoring above the trusted cutoff can be considered authentic.

CC  In a number of eukaryotes, this protein is fused to a domain that catalyses the reaction (EC 4.1.1.23). The combined activity of EC 2.4.2.10 and EC 4.1.1.23 is termed uridine 5'-monophosphate synthase.

In Rhizobium meliloti, the gene was designated exsB, possibly because of polar effects on exsA expression in a shared polycistronic mRNA. In Arthrobacter viscosus, the homologous gene was designated ALU1 and was associated with an aluminum tolerance phenotype.

Also, it can be phosphorylated by SpoIIAB on a Ser residue at position 59 of the seed alignment. A similar arrangement is inferred for RsbV, an anti-anti-sigma factor for sigma B. This Ser is fairly well conserved within a motif resembling MXS[STA]G[VIL]X[VIL][VILF] among homologous known or predicted anti-anti-sigma factors. Regions similar to SpoIIAA and apparently homologous, but differing considerably near the phosphorlated Ser of SpoIIAA, appear in a single copy in several longer proteins, but score below the trusted cutoff currently set for this superfamily HMM.

CC  The methionyl-tRNA synthetase (metG) is a class I amino acyl-tRNA ligase. This HMM appears to recognize the methionyl-tRNA synthetase of every species, including eukaryotic cytosolic and mitochondrial forms. The UPGMA difference tree calculated after search and alignment according to this HMM shows an unusual deep split between two families of MetG. One family contains forms from the Archaea, yeast cytosol, spirochetes, and E. coli, among others. The other family includes forms from yeast mitochondrion, Synechocystis sp., Bacillus subtilis, the Mycoplasmas, Aquifex aeolicus, and Helicobacter pylori. The E. coli enzyme is homodimeric, although monomeric forms can be prepared that are fully active. Activity of this enzyme in bacteria includes aminoacylation of fMet-tRNA with Met; subsequent formylation of the Met to fMet is catalyzed by a separate enzyme. Note that the protein from Aquifex aeolicus is split into an alpha (large) and beta (small) subunit; this model does not include the C-terminal region corresponding to the beta chain.

It is absent in a number of other species (e.g. Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), while Pyrococcus horikoshii has both a full length MetG and a second protein homologous to the beta chain only. Proteins hit by this HMM should called methionyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain if and only if the HMM metG hits a separate protein not also hit by this HMM.

This model is built on a seed alignment of bacterial proteins only. Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein YNL292w (Pus4) has been shown to be the pseudouridine 55 synthase of both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, active at no other position on tRNA and the only enzyme active at that position in the species. A distinct yeast protein YLR175w, (centromere/microtubule-binding protein CBF5) is an rRNA pseudouridine synthase, and the archaeal set is much more similar to CBF5 than to Pus4. It is unclear whether the archaeal proteins found by this model are tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthases like TruB, rRNA pseudouridine synthases like CBF5, or (as suggested by the absence of paralogs in the Archaea) both. CBF5 likely has additional, eukaryotic-specific functions. The trusted cutoff is set above the scores for the archaeal homologs of unknown function, so yeast Pus4p scores between trusted and noise.

This HMM describes SelA. This model excludes homologs that appear to differ in function from Frankia alni, Helicobacter pylori, Methanococcus jannaschii and other archaea, and so on.

This HMM describes SelD, known as selenophosphate synthetase, selenium donor protein, and selenide,water dikinase. SelD provides reduced selenium for the selenium transferase SelA. This protein itself contains selenocysteine in many species; any sequence scoring above the trusted cutoff but not aligning to the beginning of the HMM is likely have selenocysteine residue incorrectly interpreted as a stop codon upstream of the given sequence. The SelD protein also provides selenophosphate for the enzyme tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase, which catalyzes a tRNA base modification. It also contributes to selenium incorporation by selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylases (SDMH), in genomes with the marker TIGR03309. All genomes with SelD should make selenocysteine, selenouridine, SDMH, or some combination.

CC  Members of this family include TlyA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an rRNA methylase whose modifications are necessary to confer sensitivity to ribosome-targeting antibiotics capreomycin and viomycin. Homology supports identification as a methyltransferase. However, a parallel literature persists in calling some members hemolysins. Hemolysins are exotoxins that attack blood cell membranes and cause cell rupture, often by forming a pore in the membrane. A recent study (2013) on SCO1782 from Streptomyces coelicolor shows hemolysin activity as earlier described for a homolog from the spirochete Serpula (Treponema) hyodysenteriae and one from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The first activity, nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.1), synthesizes NAD by the salvage pathway, while the second, nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.18) synthesizes the immediate precursor of NAD by the de novo pathway. In E. coli, NadD activity is biased toward the de novo pathway while salvage activity is channeled through the multifunctional NadR protein, but this division of labor may be exceptional. The given name of this model, nicotinate (nicotinamide) nucleotide adenylyltransferase, reflects the lack of absolute specificity with respect to substrate amidation state in most species.

Synechocystis PCC6803 has a few proteins more closely related to EF-G than to any other characterized protein. Two of these resemble E. coli EF-G more closely than does the best match from the spirochetes; it may be that both function as authentic EF-G.

The eukaryotic conterpart, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF-1 alpha), is excluded from this model. EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria, as well as one of the most highly conserved, and in a number of species the gene is duplicated with identical function. When bound to GTP, EF-Tu can form a complex with any (correctly) aminoacylated tRNA except those for initiation and for selenocysteine, in which case EF-Tu is replaced by other factors. Transfer RNA is carried to the ribosome in these complexes for protein translation.

The autolytic cleavage site is an Ala-Gly bond in LexA (at position 84-85 in E. coli LexA; this sequence is replaced by Gly-Gly in Synechocystis). The cleavage leads to derepression of the SOS regulon and eventually to DNA repair. LexA in Bacillus subtilis is called DinR. LexA is much less broadly distributed than RecA.

This model describes type II, among which the eukaryotic members typically have an N-terminal extension not present in archaeal members. It can act cotranslationally. The enzyme from rat has been shown to associate with translation initiation factor 2 (IF-2) and may have a role in translational regulation.

CC  This translation releasing factor, RF-3 (prfC) was originally described as stop codon-independent, in contrast to peptide chain release factor 1 (RF-1, prfA) and RF-2 (prfB). RF-1 and RF-2 are closely related to each other, while RF-3 is similar to elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G; RF-1 is active at UAA and UAG and RF-2 is active at UAA and UGA. More recently, RF-3 was shown to be active primarily at UGA stop codons in E. coli. All bacteria and organelles have RF-1. The Mycoplasmas and organelles, which translate UGA as Trp rather than as a stop codon, lack RF-2. RF-3, in contrast, seems to be rare among bacteria and is found so far only in Escherichia coli and some other gamma subdivision Proteobacteria, in Synechocystis PCC6803, and in Staphylococcus aureus.

It removes pyroglutamate (pyrrolidone-carboxylate, a modified glutamine) that can otherwise block hydrolysis of a polypeptide at the amino end, and so can be extremely useful in the biochemical studies of proteins. The biological role in the various species in which it is found is not fully understood. The enzyme appears to be a homodimer. It does not closely resemble any other peptidases.

Homologous domains are found in eukaryotic forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in a number of other carboxylases (e.g. pyruvate carboxylase), but seed members and trusted cutoff are selected so as to exclude these. In some systems, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein and this protein (biotin carboxylase) may be shared by different carboxyltransferases. However, this model is not intended to identify the biotin carboxylase domain of propionyl-coA carboxylase. The model should hit the full length of proteins, except for chloroplast transit peptides in plants. If it hits a domain only of a longer protein, there may be a problem with the identification.

In early descriptions of this flavoprotein, a ts mutation in one region of the protein appeared to cause a defect in DNA metaobolism rather than an increased need for the pantothenate precursor beta-alanine. This protein was then called dfp, for DNA/pantothenate metabolism flavoprotein. The authors responsible for detecting phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase activity suggest renaming this bifunctional protein coaBC for its role in CoA biosynthesis. This enzyme contains the FMN cofactor, but no FAD or pyruvoyl group. The amino-terminal region contains the phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase activity.

CC  Two paralogous genes of E. coli, folB (dihydroneopterin aldolase) and folX (d-erythro-7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate epimerase) are homologous to each other and homo-octameric. In Pneumocystis carinii, a multifunctional enzyme of folate synthesis has an N-terminal region active as dihydroneopterin aldolase. This region consists of two tandem sequences each homologous to folB and forms tetramers.

CC  This model represents the glycine cleavage system H protein, which shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P protein to the T protein. The mature protein is about 130 residues long and contains a lipoyl group covalently bound to a conserved Lys residue.
CC  The genome of Aquifex aeolicus contains one protein scoring above the trusted cutoff and clustering with other bacterial H proteins, and four more proteins clustering together and scoring below the trusted cutoff; it seems doubtful that all of these homologs are authentic H protein. The Chlamydial homolog of H protein is nearly as divergent as the Aquifex outgroup, is not accompanied by P and T proteins, is not included in the seed alignment, and consequently also scores below the trusted cutoff.

This HMM, hemN_rel, models a closely related protein, shorter at the amino end and lacking the region containing the motif PYRT[SC]YP found in members of the hemN family. Several species, including E. coli, Helicobacter pylori, Aquifex aeolicus, and Chlamydia trachomatis, have members of both this family and the E. coli hemN family. The member of this family from Bacillus subtilis was shown to complement an hemF/hemN double mutant of Salmonella typimurium and to prevent accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III under anaerobic conditions, but the exact role of this protein is still uncertain. It is found in a number of species that do not synthesize heme de novo.

CC  This protein, termed NadA, plays a role in the synthesis of pyridine, a precursor to NAD. The quinolinate synthetase complex consists of A protein (this protein) and B protein. B protein converts L-aspartate to iminoaspartate, an unstable reaction product which in the absence of A protein is spontaneously hydrolyzed to form oxaloacetate. The A protein, NadA, converts iminoaspartate to quinolate.

CC  L-aspartate oxidase is the B protein, NadB, of the quinolinate synthetase complex. Quinolinate synthetase makes a precursor of the pyridine nucleotide portion of NAD. This model identifies proteins that cluster as L-aspartate oxidase (a flavoprotein difficult to separate from the set of closely related flavoprotein subunits of succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase) by both UPGMA and neighbor-joining trees. The most distant protein accepted as an L-aspartate oxidase (NadB), that from Pyrococcus horikoshii, not only clusters with other NadB but is just one gene away from NadA.

CC  NAD+ synthetase is a nearly ubiquitous enzyme for the final step in the biosynthesis of the essensial cofactor NAD. The member of this family from Bacillus subtilis is a strictly NH(3)-dependent NAD(+) synthetase of 272 amino acids. Proteins consisting only of the domain modeled here may be named as NH3-dependent NAD+ synthetase. Amidotransferase activity may reside in a separate protein, or not be present. Some other members of the family, such as from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are considerably longer, contain an apparent amidotransferase domain, and show glutamine-dependent as well as NH(3)-dependent activity.

A closely related clade of fungal PabB enzymes is identified by TIGR01823, while another bacterial clade of potential PabB enzymes is more closely related to TrpE (TIGR01824).

CC  MoaC catalyzes an early step in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis in E. coli. The Arabidopsis homolog Cnx3 complements MoaC deficiency in E. coli (MUID:95197640). Eukarotic members of this family branch within the bacterial branch, with the archaeal members as an apparent outgroup. This protein is absent in a number of the pathogens with smaller genomes, including Mycoplasmas, Chlamydias, and spirochetes, but is found in most other complete genomes to date. The homolog form Synechocystis sp. is fused to a MobA-homologous region and is an outlier to all other bacterial forms by both neighbor-joining and UPGMA analyses. Members of this family are well-conserved. The seed for this model excludes both archaeal sequences and the most divergent bacterial sequences, but still finds all candidate MoaC sequences easily between trusted and noise cutoffs. We suggest that sequences branching outside the set that contains all seed members be regarded only as putative functional equivalents of MoaC unless and until a member of the archaeal outgroup is shown to have equivalent function.

CC  This conserved hypothetical protein with four predicted transmembrane regions is found in E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Helicobacter pylori, among completed genomes. A similar protein from Aquifex aeolicus appears to share a central region of homology and a similar overall arrangement of hydrophobic stretches, and forms a bidirectional best hit with several members of the seed alignment. However, it is uncertain whether the observed similarity represents full-length homology and/or equivalent function, and so it is excluded from the seed and scores below the trusted cutoff.

CC  The DNA primase DnaG of E. coli and its apparent orthologs in other eubacterial species are approximately 600 residues in length. Within this set, a conspicuous outlier in percent identity, as seen in a UPGMA difference tree, is the branch containing the Mycoplasmas. This lineage is also unique in containing the small, DNA primase-related protein modelled by this HMM, which is homologous to the central third of DNA primase. Several small regions of sequence similarity specifically to Mycoplasma sequences rather than to all DnaG homologs suggests that the divergence of this protein from DnaG post-dated the separation of bacterial lineages. The function of this DNA primase-related protein is unknown.

CC  This model describes a subclass of aspartate kinases. These are mostly Lys-sensitive and not fused to homoserine dehydrogenase, unlike some Thr-sensitive and Met-sensitive forms. Homoserine dehydrogenase is part of Thr and Met but not Lys biosynthetic pathways.
CC  Aspartate kinase catalyzes a first step in the biosynthesis from Asp of Lys (and its precursor diaminopimelate), Met, and Thr. In E. coli, a distinct isozyme is inhibited by each of the three amino acid products. The Met-sensitive (I) and Thr-sensitive (II) forms are bifunctional enzymes fused to homoserine dehydrogenases and form homotetramers, while the Lys-sensitive form (III) is a monofunctional homodimer.
CC  The Lys-sensitive enzyme of Bacillus subtilis resembles the E. coli form but is an alpha 2/beta 2 heterotetramer, where the beta subunit is translated from an in-phase alternative initiator at Met-246. The protein slr0657 from Synechocystis PCC6803 is extended by a duplication of the C-terminal region corresponding to the beta chain. Incorporation of a second copy of the C-terminal domain may be quite common in this subgroup of aspartokinases.

CC  Members of this family are 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate synthase, previously (incorrectly) called dihydrodipicolinate synthase. It is a homotetrameric enzyme of lysine biosynthesis. E. coli has several paralogs closely related to dihydrodipicoline synthase (DapA), as well as the more distant N-acetylneuraminate lyase. In Pyrococcus horikoshii, the bidirectional best hit with E. coli is to an uncharacterized paralog of DapA, not DapA itself, and it is omitted from the seed. The putative members from the Chlamydias (pathogens with a parasitic metabolism) are easily the most divergent members of the multiple alignment.

The structure of this homotetrameric enzyme related to dihydrodipicolinate synthase is known. In Clostridium tertium, the enzyme appears to be in an operon with a secreted sialidase that releases sialic acid from host sialoglycoconjugates. In several E. coli strains, however, this enzyme is responsible for N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid synthesis for capsule production by condensing N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and pyruvate.

CC  Trehalose, a neutral disaccharide of two glucose residues, is an important osmolyte for dessication and/or salt tolerance in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, including E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Many bacteria also utilize trehalose in the synthesis of trehalolipids, specialized cell wall constituents believed to be involved in the uptake of hydrophobic substances.  Trehalose dimycolate (TDM, cord factor) and related substances are important constituents of the mycobacterial waxy coat and responsible for various clinically important immunological interactions with host organism [5].
CC  This enzyme, trehalose-phosphatase, removes a phosphate group in the final step of trehalose biosynthesis. The trehalose-phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is fused to the synthase.
CC  At least 18 distinct sequences from Arabidopsis have been identified, roughly half of these are of the fungal type, with a fused synthase and half are like the bacterial members having only the phosphatase domain.  It has been suggested [3,4] that trehalose is being used in Arabidopsis as a regulatory molecule in development and possibly other processes.

A well-conserved repeated domain in this family, approximately 60 residues in length, is also repeated in the Na/Pi cotransporters, although with greater spacing between the repeats.

CC  This HMM describes ribosomal protein S1, RpsA. This protein is found in most bacterial genomes in a single copy, but is not present in the Mycoplasmas. It is heterogeneous with respect to the number of repeats of the S1 RNA binding domain described by PFAM HMM PF00575: six repeats in E. coli and most other bacteria, four in Bacillus subtilis and some other species.
CC  rpsA is an essential gene in E. coli but not in B. subtilis. It is associated with the cytidylate kinase gene cmk in many species, and fused to it in Treponema pallidum.
CC  RpsA is proposed (Medline:97323001) to assist in mRNA degradation.
CC  This model provides trusted hits to most long form (6 repeat) examples of RpsA. Among homologs with only four repeats are some to which other (perhaps secondary) functions have been assigned.

In Strep. pneumoniae, inactivation of dprA had no effect on the uptake of DNA [3]. All of these data indicated that DprA is required at a later stage in transformation.  Subsequently DprA and RecA were both shown in S. pneumoniae to be required to protect incoming ssDNA from immediate degradation. [4].   Role of DprA in non-transformable species is not known.

CC  While this protein is part of the preprotein translocase in Escherichia coli, it is not essential for viability or protein secretion.  The N-terminus region contains a predicted membrane-spanning region followed by a region consisting almost entirely of residues with charged (acidic, basic, or zwitterionic) side chains. This small protein is about 100 residues in length, and is restricted to bacteria; however, this protein is absent from some lineages, including spirochetes and Mycoplasmas.

CC  This HMM describes enzymes that perform as 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase, one of four enzymes required for the de novo biosynthesis of pantothenate (vitamin B5) from Asp and 2-oxoisovalerate. Although few members of the seed alignment are characterized experimentally, nearly all from complete genomes are found in a genome-wide (but not local) context of all three other pantothenate-biosynthetic enzymes (TIGR00222, TIGR00018, TIGR00223). The gene encoding this enzyme is designated apbA in Salmonella typhimurium and panE in Escherichia coli; this protein functions as a monomer and functions in the alternative pyrimidine biosynthetic, or APB, pathway, used to synthesize the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine. Note, synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine occurs either via the first five steps in de novo purine biosynthesis, which uses the pur gene products, or through the APB pathway.  Note that this family includes both NADH and NADPH-dependent enzymes, and enzymes with broad specificity, such as a D-mandelate dehydrogease that is also a 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase.

CC  In most species, carbamate kinase works in arginine catabolism and consumes carbamoyl phosphate to convert ADP into ATP. In the pathway in Pyrococcus furiosus, the enzyme acts instead to generate carbamoyl phosphate.
CC  The seed alignment for this model includes experimentally confirmed examples from a set of phylogenetically distinct species. In a neighbor-joining tree constructed from an alignment of candidate carbamate kinases and several acetylglutamate kinases, the latter group forms a clear outgroup which roots the tree of carbamate kinase-like proteins. This analysis suggests that in E. coli, the ArcC paralog YqeA may be a second isozyme, while the paralog YahI branches as an outlier and is less likely to be an authentic carbamate kinase. The homolog from Mycoplasma pneumoniae likewise branches outside the set containing known carbamate kinases and also scores below the trusted cutoff.

CC  This family of archaeal proteins shows considerable homology and identical active site residues to the bacterial hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG-CoA synthase, modeled by TIGR01835) which is the second step in the mevalonate pathway of IPP biosynthesis [1].  
CC  An enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide diacetyl-phloroglucinol is more closely related, but lacks the active site residues [2].
CC  In each of the genomes containing a member of this family there is no other recognized HMG-CoA synthase, although other elements of the mevalonate pathway are in evidence.  The only archaeon currently sequenced which lacks a homolog in this pathway is Halobacterium, which _does_ contain a separate HMG-CoA synthase.
CC  Thus, although there is no experimental evidence supporting this name, the bioinformatics-based conclusion appears to be sound.

Note: this family was classified as subfamily rather than equivalog because it includes a counterexample from Pseudomonas putida, MdeB, that is active as an E1 component of an alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex rather than a pyruvate dehydrogase complex. The second pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 protein from Alcaligenes eutrophus, PdhE, complements an aceE mutant of E. coli but is not part of a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex operon, is more similar to the Pseudomonas putida MdeB than to E. coli AceE, and may have also have a different primary specificity.

This suggests both recent paralogy and diversity of function. DegV itself is encoded immediately downstream of DegU, a transcriptional regulator of degradation, but is itself uncharacterized. Crystallography suggested a lipid-binding site, while comparison of the crystal structure to dihydroxyacetone kinase and to a mannose transporter EIIA domain suggests a conserved domain, EDD, with phosphotransferase activity.

Because several species, including Thermotoga maritima and Treponema pallidum, contain both a close homolog of the lon protease and nearly full-length homolog of the  members of this family, we suggest there may also be a functional division between the two families.

CC  These proteins are members of the ATP:ADP Antiporter (AAA) Family (TC 2.A.12), which consists of nucleotide transporters that have 12 GES predicted transmembrane regions. One protein from Rickettsia prowazekii functions to take up ATP from the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm into the bacterium in exchange for ADP.  Five AAA family paralogues are encoded within the genome of R. prowazekii. This organism transports UMP and GMP but not CMP, and it seems likely that one or more of the AAA family paralogues are responsible. The genome of Chlamydia trachomatis encodes two AAA family members, Npt1 and Npt2, which catalyse ATP/ADP exchange and GTP, CTP, ATP and UTP uptake probably employing a proton symport mechanism. Two homologous adenylate translocators of Arabidopsis thaliana are postulated to be localized to the intracellular plastid membrane where they function as ATP importers.

The two Escherichia coli proteins, DcuA and DcuB, transport aspartate, malate, fumarate and succinate, and function as antiporters with any two of these substrates. Since DcuA is encoded in an operon with the gene for aspartase, and DcuB is encoded in an operon with the gene for fumarase, their physiological functions may be to catalyze aspartate:fumarate and fumarate:malate exchange during the anaerobic utilization of aspartate and fumarate, respectively.

Members of the family have been sequenced from yeast, protozoans and animals. Animals such as C. elegans  possess many of these transporters. Humans have at least two closely related isoforms of the UDP-galactose:UMP exchange transporter.
CC  NSTs generally appear to function by antiport mechanisms, exchanging a nucleotide-sugar for a nucleotide. Thus, CMP-sialic acid is exchanged for CMP; GDP-mannose is preferentially exchanged for GMP, and UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine are exchanged for UMP (or possibly UDP). Other nucleotide sugars (e.g., GDP-fucose, UDP-xylose, UDP-glucose, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, etc.) may also be transported in exchange for various nucleotides, but their transporters have not been molecularly characterized. Each compound appears to be translocated by its own transport protein. Transport allows the compound, synthesized in the cytoplasm, to be exported to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum where it is used for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

The B. subtilis NupC is specific for pyrimidine nucleosides (cytidine and uridine and the corresponding deoxyribonucleosides).

CC  One human homologue(CNT1) transports pyrimidine nucleosides and adenosine, but deoxyadenosine and guanosine are poor substrates of this permease. Another (CNT2) is selective for purine nucleosides. Alteration of just a few amino acyl residues in TMSs 7 and 8 interconverts their specificities.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  The SulP family is a large and ubiquitous family with over 30 sequenced members derived from bacteria, fungi, plants and
CC  animals. Many organisms including Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis sp, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and
CC  Caenorhabditis elegans possess multiple SulP family paralogues. Many of these proteins are functionally characterized, and all
CC  are sulfate uptake transporters. Some transport their substrate with high affinities, while others transport it with relatively low
CC  affinities. Most function by SO42- :H+symport, but SO42- :HCO3- antiport has been reported for the rat protein (spP45380).
CC  The bacterial proteins vary in size from 434 residues to 566 residues with one exception, a Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein
CC  with 784 residues. The eukaryotic proteins vary in size from 611 residues to 893 residues with one exception, a protein
CC  designated "early nodulin 70 protein" from Glycine max which is reported to be of 485 residues. Thus, the eukaryotic proteins are
CC  almost without exception larger than the prokaryotic proteins. These proteins exhibit 10-13 putative transmembrane a-helical
CC  spanners (TMSs) depending on the protein.
CC  The phylogenetic tree for the SulP family reveals five principal branches. Three of these are bacterial specific as follows: one
CC  bears a single protein from M. tuberculosis; a second bears two proteins, one from M. tuberculosis, the other from Synechocystis
CC  sp, and the third bears all remaining prokaryotic proteins. The remaining two clusters bear only eukaryotic proteins with the
CC  animal proteins all localized to one branch and the plant and fungal proteins localized to the other.
CC  The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by SulP family proteins are:
CC  (1) SO42- (out) + nH+ (out) --> SO42- (in) + nH+ (in).
CC  (2) SO42- (out) + nHCO3- (in)  SO42- (in) + nHCO3- (out).

CC  Functionally characterized members of the TPT family are derived from the inner envelope membranes of chloroplasts and nongreen plastids of plants. However,
CC  homologues are also present in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three functionally uncharacterized TPT paralogues encoded within its genome. Under normal physiological
CC  conditions, chloroplast TPTs mediate a strict antiport of substrates, frequently exchanging an organic three carbon compound phosphate ester for inorganic phosphate (Pi).
CC  Normally, a triose-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, or another phosphorylated C3 compound made in the chloroplast during photosynthesis, exits the organelle into the
CC  cytoplasm of the plant cell in exchange for Pi. However, experiments with reconstituted translocator in artificial membranes indicate that transport can also occur by a
CC  channel-like uniport mechanism with up to 10-fold higher transport rates. Channel opening may be induced by a membrane potential of large magnitude and/or by high substrate
CC  concentrations. Nongreen plastid and chloroplast carriers, such as those from maize endosperm and root membranes, mediate transport of C3 compounds phosphorylated at
CC  carbon atom 2, particularly phosphenolpyruvate, in exchange for Pi. These are the phosphoenolpyruvate:Pi antiporters (PPT). Glucose-6-P has also been shown to be a
CC  substrate of some plastid translocators (GPT). The three types of proteins (TPT, PPT and GPT) are divergent in sequence as well as substrate specificity, but their substrate
CC  specificities overlap.

CC  All functionally characterized members of the Amt family are ammonia or ammonium uptake transporters. Some, but not others, also transport methylammonium.
CC  The mechanism of energy coupling, if any, to methyl-NH2 or NH3 uptake by the AmtB protein of E. coli is not entirely clear. NH4+ uniport driven by the pmf, energy independent NH3 facilitation, and NH4+/K+ antiport have been proposed as possible transport mechanisms. In Corynebacterium glutamicum and Arabidopsis thaliana, uptake via the Amt1 homologues of AmtB has been reported to be driven by the pmf.

CC  The Polycystin Cation Channel (PCC) Family (TC 1.A.5)
CC  Polycystin is a huge protein of 4303aas. Its repeated leucine-rich (LRR) segment is found in many proteins. It contains 16 polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains, one LDL-receptor class A domain, one C-type lectin family domain, and 16-18 putative TMSs in positions between residues 2200 and 4100.
CC  Polycystin-L has been shown to be a cation (Na+, K+ and Ca2+) channel that is activated by Ca2+. Two members of the PCC family (polycystin 1 and 2) are mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and polycystin-L is deleted in mice with renal and retinal defects.
CC  Note: this model is restricted to the amino half because a full-length model is incompatible with the HMM software package.

CC  The Bcl-2 (Bcl-2) Family (TC 1.A.21)
CC  The Bcl-2 family consists of the apoptosis regulator, Bcl-X, and its homologues. Bcl-X is a dominant regulator of programmed cell death in mammalian cells.
CC  The long form (Bcl-X(L)) displays cell death repressor activity, but the short isoform (Bcl-X(S)) and the b-isoform (Bcl-Xb) promote cell death. Bcl-X(L),
CC  Bcl-X(S) and Bcl-Xb are three isoforms derived by alternative RNA splicing. Bcl-X(S) forms heterodimers with Bcl-2. Homologues of Bcl-X include the Bax (rat; 192 aas; spQ63690) and Bak (mouse; 208 aas; spO08734) proteins which also influence
CC  apoptosis.
CC  Using isolated mitochondria, recombinant Bax and Bak have been shown to induce Dy loss, swelling and cytochrome c release. All of these changes are
CC  dependent on Ca2+ and are prevented by cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid, both of which are known to close permeability transition pores (megachannels).
CC  Coimmimoprecipitation studies revealed that Bax and Bak interact with VDAC to form permeability transition pores. Thus, even though they can form channels
CC  in artificial membranes at acidic pH, proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (including Bax and Bak) probably induce the mitochondrial permeability transition and cytochrome c release by interacting with permeability transition pores, the most important component for pore fomation of which is VDAC.

CC  The Epithelial Na+ Channel (ENaC) Family (TC 1.A.06)
CC  The ENaC family consists of sodium channels from animals and has no recognizable homologues in other eukaryotes or bacteria. The vertebrate ENaC proteins from epithelial cells cluster tightly together on the phylogenetic tree: voltage-insensitive ENaC homologues are also found in the brain. Eleven sequenced C. elegans proteins, including the degenerins, are distantly related to the vertebrate proteins as well as to each other. At least some of
CC  these proteins form part of a mechano-transducing complex for touch sensitivity. Other members of the ENaC family, the acid-sensing ion channels, ASIC1-3,
CC  are homo- or hetero-oligomeric neuronal H+-gated channels that mediate pain sensation in response to tissue acidosis. The homologous Helix aspersa
CC  (FMRF-amide)-activated Na+ channel is the first peptide neurotransmitter-gated ionotropic receptor to be sequenced.
CC  Mammalian ENaC is important for the maintenance of Na+ balance and the regulation of blood pressure. Three homologous ENaC subunits, a, b and g, have
CC  been shown to assemble to form the highly Na+-selective channel.
CC  This Hmm is designed from the invertebrate members of the ENaC family.

The yeast Sec62 protein has been shown to be essential for cell growth. The mammalian NS channel proteins has been implicated in platelet derived growth factor(PGDF) dependent single channel current in fibroblasts. These channels are essentially closed in serum deprived tissue-culture cells and are specifically opened by exposure to PDGF. These channels are reported to exhibit equal selectivity for Na+, K+ and Cs+ with low permeability to Ca2+, and no permeability to anions.

CC  The Transient Receptor Potential Ca2+ Channel (TRP-CC) Family (TC. 1.A.4)

CC  TRP and TRPL (Montell and Rubin, 1989; Hardie and Minke, 1993). SOC members of the family mediate the entry of extracellular Ca2+ into cells in response
CC  to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Clapham, 1996) and agonist stimulated production of inositol-1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3). One member of the TRP-CC
CC  family, mammalian Htrp3, has been shown to form a tight complex with the IP3 receptor (TC #1.A.3.2.1). This interaction is apparently required for IP3 to
CC  stimulate Ca2+ release via Htrp3. The vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), which is the receptor for capsaicin (the ?hot? ingredient in chili peppers) and serves
CC  as a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway (Caterina et al., 1997), is also a member of this family. The stretch-inhibitable non-selective cation channel
CC  (SIC) is identical to the vanilloid receptor throughout all of its first 700 residues, but it exhibits a different sequence in its last 100 residues. VR1 and SIC
CC  transport monovalent cations as well as Ca2+. VR1 is about 10x more permeable to Ca2+ than to monovalent ions. Ca2+ overload probably causes cell death
CC  after chronic exposure to capsaicin. (McCleskey and Gold, 1999).

GS  nusG
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  NusG proteins are transcription factors which are aparrently universal in prokaryotes (archaea and eukaryotes have homologs that may have related functions).  The essential components of these factors include an N-terminal RNP-like (ribonucleoprotein) domain and a C-terminal KOW motif (PF00467) believed to be a nucleic acid binding domain [3].   In E. coli, NusA has been shown to interact with RNA polymerase and termination factor Rho.  This model covers a wide variety of bacterial species but excludes mycoplasmas which are covered by a separate model (TIGR01956).
CC  The function of all of these NusG proteins is likely to be the same at the level of interaction with RNA and other protein factors to affect termination; however different species may utilize NusG towards different processes and in combination with different suites of affector proteins.
CC  In E. coli, NusG promotes rho-dependent termination. It is an essential gene. In Streptomyces virginiae and related species, an additional N-terminal sequence is also present and is suggested to play a role in butyrolactone-mediated autoregulation. In Thermotoga maritima, NusG has a long insert, fails to substitute for E. coli NusG (with or without the long insert), is a large 0.7 % of total cellular protein, and has a general, sequence non-specific DNA and RNA binding activity that blocks ethidium staining, yet permits transcription.
CC  Archaeal proteins once termed NusG share the KOW domain but are actually a ribosomal protein corresponding to L24p in bacterial and L26e in eukaryotes (TIGR00405).

A related model (TIGR01912) represents the archaeal clade of this family.  TatC is often found in a gene cluster with the two other components of the system, TatA/E (TIGR01411) and TatB (TIGR01410).  A model also exists for the Twin-arginine signal sequence (TIGR01409).

CC  This family of proteins is suggested to transport inorganic carbon (HCO3-), based on the phenotype of a mutant of IctB in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. Bicarbonate uptake is used by many photosynthetic organisms including cyanobacteria. These organisms are able to concentrate CO2/HCO3- against a greater than ten-fold concentration gradient. Cyanobacteria may have several such carriers operating with different efficiencies. Note that homology to various O-antigen ligases, with possible implications for mutant cell envelope structure, might allow alternatives to the interpretation of IctB as a bicarbonate transport protein.

The protein topology and function was experimentally demonstrated by epitope tagging and immunofluorescence. Insertion of tags in the critical regions associated with drug efflux, abrogated its function. The C-terminal domain seem to highly conserved.

CC  Phosphonates are a class of compound analogous to organic phosphates, but in which the C-O-P linkage is replaced by a direct, stable C-P bond. Some bacteria can utilize phosphonates as a source of phosphorus. This family consists of permease proteins of known or predicted phosphonate ABC transporters.  Often this protein is found as a duplicated pair, occasionally as a fused pair.  Certain "second" copies score in between the trusted and noise cutoff and should be considered true hits (by context).

CC  Phosphonates are a varied class of phosphorus-containing organic compound in which a direct C-P bond is found, rather than a C-O-P linkage of the phosphorus through an oxygen atom. They may be toxic but also may be used as sources of phosphorus and energy by various bacteria. Phosphonate utilization systems typically are encoded in 14 or more genes, including a three gene ABC transporter. This family includes the periplasmic binding protein component of ABC transporters for phosphonates [1] as well as other, related binding components for closely related substances such as phosphate [2] and phosphite [3].  A number of members of this family are found in genomic contexts with components of selenium metabolic processes suggestive of a role in selenate or other selenium-compound transport.
CC  A subset of this model in which nearly all members exhibit genomic context with elements of phosphonate metabolism, particularly the C-P lyase system (GenProp0232, [4]) has been built (TIGR03431) as an equivalog.  Nevertheless, there are members of this subfamily (TIGR01098) which show up sporadically on a phylogenetic tree that also show phosphonate context and are most likely competent to transport phosphonates.

CC  This model describes the P-type ATPases responsible for the exchange of either protons or sodium ions for potassium ions across the plasma membranes of eukaryotes.  Unlike most other P-type ATPases, members of this subfamily require a beta subunit for activity.
CC  This model encompasses eukaryotes and consists of two functional types, a Na/K antiporter found widely distributed in eukaryotes and a H/K antiporter found only in vertebrates [1].
CC  The Na+ or H+/K+ antiporter P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IIC based on a published phylogenetic analysis [2].
CC  Sequences from Blastocladiella emersonii (GP|6636502, GP|6636502 and PIR|T43025), C. elegans (GP|2315419, GP|6671808 and PIR|T31763) and Drosophila melanogaster (GP|7291424) score below trusted cutoff, apparently due to long branch length (excessive divergence from the last common ancestor) as evidenced by a phylogenetic tree.  Experimental evidence is needed to determine whether these sequences represent ATPases with conserved function.  Aside from fragments, other sequences between trusted and noise appear to be bacterial ATPases of unclear lineage, but most likely calcium pumps.

Essentially, it couples the energy derived from decarboxylation of a carboxylic acid substrate to move Na+ ion across the bilayer. Functional malonate decarboylase is a multi subunit protein. The alpha subunit enzymatically performs the transfer of malonate (substrate) to an acyl carrier protein subunit for subsequent decarboxylation, hence the name: acetyl-S-acyl carrier protein:malonate carrier protein-SH transferase.

At the core of reacion center is a collection light-harvesting cofactors and closely associated polypeptides. The core protein complex is made of L, M and H subunits. The common cofactors include bacterichlorophyll, bacteriopheophytins, ubiquinone and no-heme ferrous iron. The net result of electron tranfer reactions is the establishment of proton electrochemical gradient and production of reducing equivalents in form of NADH. Ultimately the process results in the reduction of C02 to carbohydrates(C6H12O6) In non-oxygenic organisms, the electron donor is some organic acid and not water. Much of our current functional understanding of photosynthesis comes from the structural determination, spectroscopic studies and mutational analysis on the reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides.

CC  Bacterial forms should be designated ATP synthase, F0 subunit A; eukaryotic (chloroplast and mitochondrial) forms should be designated ATP synthase, F0 subunit 6.
CC  The F1/F0 ATP synthase is a multisubunit, membrane associated enzyme found in bacteria and mitochondria and chloroplast. This enzyme is principally involved in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by coupling the energy derived from the proton electrochemical gradient across the biological membrane. A brief description of this multisubunit enzyme complex: F1 and F0 represent two major clusters of subunits. Individual subunits in each of these clusters are named differently in prokaryotes and in organelles e.g., mitochondria and chloroplast. The bacterial equivalent of subunit 6 is named subunit 'A'. It has been shown that proton is conducted though this subunit. Typically, deprotonation and reprotonation of the acidic amino acid side-chains are implicated in the process.

CC  This model describes the photosynthetic reaction center H subunit in non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. The reaction center is an  integral membrane pigment-protein that carries out light-driven electron transfer reactions. At the core of reaction center is a collection light-harvesting cofactors and closely associated polypeptides. The core protein complex is made of L, M and H subunits. The common cofactors include bacterichlorophyll, bacteriopheophytins, ubiquinone and no-heme ferrous iron. The net result of electron tranfer reactions is the establishment of proton electrochemical gradient and production of reducing equivalents in the form of NADH. Ultimately, the process results in the reduction of C02 to carbohydrates(C6H12O6) In non-oxygenic organisms, the electron donor is an organic acid rather than water. Much of our current functional understanding of photosynthesis comes from the structural determination and spectroscopic studies on the reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides.

Photosystem II is many ways functionally equivalent to bacterial reaction center. At the core of Photosystem II are several light harvesting cofactors including plastoquinones, pheophytins, phyloquinones etc. These cofactors are intimately associated with the polypeptides, which principally including subunits DI, DII, Cyt.b, Cyt.f and iron-sulphur protein. Together they participate in the electron transfer reactions that lead to the net production of the reducting equivalents in the form of NADPH, which are used for reduction of CO2 to carbohydrates(C6H1206). Phosystem II operates during oxygenic photosynthesis and principal electron donor is H2O.

Hits that do not lie at the C-terminus or are not found in Gram-positive bacteria are probably false-positive.

CC  This model describes cyclic peptide transporter in bacteria. Bacteria have elaborate pathways for the production of toxins and secondary metabolites. Many such compounds, including syringomycin and pyoverdine are synthesized on non-ribosomal templates consisting of a multienzyme complex. On several occasions the proteins of the complex and transporter protein are present on the same operon. Often times these compounds cross the biological membrane by specific transporters. Syringomycin is an amphipathic, cylclic lipodepsipeptide when inserted into host causes formation of channels, permeable to variety of cations. On the other hand, pyoverdine is a cyclic octa-peptidyl dihydroxyquinoline, which is efficient in sequestering iron for uptake.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model describes the Nramp metal ion transporter family.  Historically, in mammals these proteins have been functionally characterized as proteins involved in the host pathogen resistance, hence the name - NRAMP. At least two isoforms Nramp1 and Nramp2 have been identified. However the exact mechanism of pathogen resistance was unclear, until it was demonstrated by expression cloning and electrophysiological techniques that this protein was a metal ion transporter. It was also independently demonstrated that a microcytic anemia (mk) locus in mouse, encodes a metal ion transporter (DCT1 or Nramp2). The transporter has a broad range of substrate specificity that include Fe+2, Zn+2, Mn+2, Co+2, Cd+2, Cu+2, Ni+2 and Pb+2. The uptake of these metal ions is coupled to proton symport. Metal ions are essential cofactors in a number of biological process including, oxidative phosphorylation, gene regulation and metal ion homeostasis. Nramp1 could confer resistance to infection in one of the two ways. (1) The uptake of Fe+2 can produce toxic hydroxyl radicals via Fenton reaction killing the pathogens in phagosomes or (2) Deplete the metal ion pools in the phagosome and deprive the pathogens of metal ions, which is critical for its survival.

Family TIGR01212, widespread in prokaryotes, lacks the GNAT acetyltransferase domain but shares extensive sequence similarity with this family (TIGR01211).

EN  radical SAM protein, TIGR01212 family
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are apparent radical-SAM enzymes, related to the N-terminal region of the bifunctional ELP3, whose C-terminal region is part of the elongator complex and appears to acetylate histones and other proteins. ELP3 binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and was recently shown to be involved in a DNA demethylation process in eukaryotes. Close sequence similarity of this family (with lacks the GNAT family acetyltransferase domain) to the ELP3 N-terminal region and a strong match to the Pfam model PF04055 support identification of this family as radical SAM despite the atypical spacing between first and second Cys residues in the 4Fe4S-binding motif.

An experimentally confirmed Gram-positive lineage succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase has been described for Corynebacterium glutamicum (SP:Q59284), and a neighbor-joining tree shows the seed members, SP:Q59284, and putative archaeal members such as TrEMBL:O58003 in a single clade. However, the archaeal members differ substantially, share a number of motifs with acetylornithine deacetylases rather than succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylases, and are not taken as trusted examples of  succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylases. This model is limited to proteobacterial members for this reason.

CC  This HMM describes the conserved core region of the beta subunit of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels in animals. Amino-terminal regions differ substantially, in part by alternative splicing, and are not included in the model. Four beta subunits form a complex with four alpha subunit cytoplasmic (T1) regions, and the structure of the complex is solved. The beta subunit belongs to a family of NAD(P)H-dependent aldo-keto reductases, binds NADPH, and couples voltage-gated channel activity to the redox potential of the cell.
CC  Plant beta subunits and their closely related bacterial homologs (in Deinococcus radiudurans, Xylella fastidiosa, etc.) appear more closely related to each other than to animal forms. However, the bacterial species lack convincing counterparts the Kv alpha subunit and the Kv beta homolog may serve as an enzyme. Cutoffs are set for this model such that yeast and plant forms and bacterial close homologs score between trusted and noise cutoffs.

However, no other candidate for this enzyme is present in that species, chorismate biosynthesis does occur, other species having this protein lack carboxysomes but appear to make chorismate, and a requirement of CcmA for carboxysome formation does not prohibit a role in chorismate biosynthesis.

CC  Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (CPSase) catalyzes the first committed step in pyrimidine, arginine, and urea biosynthesis. In general, it is a glutamine-dependent enzyme, EC 6.3.5.5, termed CPSase II in eukaryotes. An exception is the mammalian mitochondrial urea-cycle form,
CC  CPSase I, in which the glutamine amidotransferase domain active site Cys on the small subunit has been lost, and the enzyme is ammonia-dependent. In both CPSase I and the closely related, glutamine-dependent CPSase III (allosterically activated by acetyl-glutamate) demonstrated in some other vertebrates, the small and large chain regions are fused in a single polypeptide chain. This HMM represents the large chain of glutamine-hydrolysing carbamoyl-phosphate synthases, or the corresponding regions of larger, multifunctional proteins, as found in all domains of life, and CPSase I forms are considered exceptions within the family.
CC  In several thermophilic species (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Methanococcus jannaschii, Aquifex aeolicus), the large subunit appears split, at different points, into two separate genes.

CC  Original assignment of this protein family as cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase is controversial, supported by PMID:11333988 but challenged by PMID:14679218 and by subsequent discovery of the actual mechanism for synthesizing Cys-tRNA in species where a direct Cys--tRNA ligase was not found. Lingering legacy annotations of members of this family probably should be removed. Evidence against the role includes a signal peptide. This family as been renamed "extracellular protein" to facilitate correction. Members of this family occur in Deinococcus radiodurans (bacterial) and Methanococcus jannaschii (archaeal). A number of homologous but more distantly related proteins are annotated as alpha-1,4 polygalactosaminidases. The function remains unknown.

However, published reports of ThiJ activity and identification of a ThiJ/ThiD bifunctional protein describe an unrelated locus mapping near ThiM, rather than the DJ-1 homolog of E. coli. The ThiJ designation for this family may be spurious; the cited paper PMID:8885414 refers to a locus near thiD and thiM in E. coli, unlike the gene represented here. Current public annotation reflects ThiJ/ThiD bifunctional activity, apparently a property of ThiD and not of this locus.

Bacteria are unable to transport 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotides into the cytoplasm.   2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase contains 2 active sites which catalyze the reactions that convert the 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide into a 3'-nucleotide, which is then converted into nucleic acid and phosphate.  Both final products can be transported into the cytoplasm.  Thus, it has been suggested that 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase has a 'scavenging' function.  Experimental evidence indicates that 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase enables Yersinia enterocolitica O:8 to grow on 2'3'-cAMP as a sole source of carbon and energy (PMID:11160814).

This model describes a family of predicted long, non-Sec signal sequences and signal-anchor sequences (uncleaved signal sequences). All contain an absolutely conserved pair of arginine residues, in a motif approximated by (S/T)-R-R-X-F-L-K, followed by a membrane-spanning hydrophobic region.
CC  Members with small amino acid side chains at the -1 and -3 positions from the C-terminus of the model should be predicted to be cleaved as are Sec pathway signal sequences. Members are almost exclusively bacterial, although archaeal sequences are also found. A large fraction of the members of this family may have bound redox-active cofactors.

CC  This enzyme is a member of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases (PF00702), and contains a modified version of the conserved catalytic motifs of that superfamily: the first motif is usually DxDx(T/V), here it is DxAxT, and in the third motif the normal conserved lysine is instead an arginine.  Additionally, the enzyme contains a unique conserved catalytic lysine (B. cereus pos. 53) which is involved in the binding and activation of the substrate through the formation of a Schiff base.  The substrate of this enzyme is the product of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) transaminase, phosphonoacetaldehyde.  This degradation pathway for AEP may be related to its toxic properties which are utilized by microorganisms as a chemical warfare agent.

CC  The tripeptide glutathione is an important reductant, e.g., for maintaining the cellular thiol/disulfide status and for protecting against reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. Glutathione-disulfide reductase regenerates reduced glutathione from oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide) + NADPH. This HMM represents one of two closely related subfamilies of glutathione-disulfide reductase. Both are closely related to trypanothione reductase, and separate models are built so each of the three can describe proteins with conserved function. This model describes glutathione-disulfide reductases of plants and some bacteria, including cyanobacteria.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  PGP is an essential enzyme in the glycolate salvage pathway in higher organisms (photorespiration in plants).  Phosphoglycolate results from the oxidase activity of RubisCO in the Calvin cycle when concentrations of carbon dioxide are low relative to oxygen.
CC  In Ralstonia (Alcaligenes) eutropha and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the PGP gene (CbbZ) is located on an operon along with other Calvin cycle enzymes including RubisCO [1,2].  The only other pertinent experimental evidence concerns the gene from E. coli [3].  The in vitro activity of the Ralstonia and Escherichia enzymes was determined with crude cell extracts of strains containing PGP on expression plasmids and compared to controls. In E. coli, however, there does not appear to be a functional Calvin cycle (RubisCO is absent), although the E. coli PGP gene (gph) is on the same operon (dam) with ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase (rpe), a gene in the pentose-phosphate pathway (along with other, unrelated genes).  The E. coli enzyme is not expressed under normal laboratory conditions; the pathway to which it belongs has not been determined.  In fact, the possibility exists, although unlikely, that the E. coli enzyme and others within this equivalog have as their physiological substrate another, closely related molecule.
CC  The other seed chosen for this model, from Xylella fastidiosa has no experimental evidence, but is a plant pathogen and thus may obtain phosphoglycolate from its host.
CC  This model has been restricted to encompass only proteobacteria as no related PGP has been verified outside of this clade.  Sequences from Aquifex aeolicus and Treponema pallidum fall between the trusted and noise cutoffs.
CC  Just below the noise cutoff is a gene which is part of the operon for the biosynthesis of the blue pigment, indigoidine, from Erwinia (Pectobacterium) chrysanthemi, a plant pathogen [4].  It does not seem likely, considering the proposed biosynthetic mechanism, that the dephosphorylation of phosphoglycolate or a closely related compound is required.  Possibly, this gene is fortuitously located in this operon, or has an indirect relationship to the necessity for the biosynthesis of this compound.
CC  Sequences from 11 species have been annotated as PGP or putative PGP but fall below the noise cutoff.  None of these have experimental validation.
CC  This enzyme is a member of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolase enzymes (PF00702).

CC  PGP [1] is an essential enzyme in the glycolate salvage pathway in higher organisms (photorespiration in plants).  Phosphoglycolate results from the oxidase activity of RubisCO in the Calvin cycle when concentrations of carbon dioxide are low relative to oxygen.  In mammals, PGP is found in many tissues, notably in red blood cells where P-glycolate is and important activator of the hydrolysis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a major modifier of the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.
CC  Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP, Vitamin B6) phosphatase [2] is involved in the degradation of PLP in mammals and is widely distributed in human tissues including erythrocyes.
CC  The enzymes described here are members of the Haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of hydrolase enzymes (PF00702).  Unlike the bacterial PGP equivalog (TIGR01449), which is a member of class (subfamily) I, these enzymes are members of class (subfamily) II [4].  These two families have almost certainly arisen from convergent evolution (although these two ancestors may themselves have diverged from a more distant HAD superfamily progenitor).
CC  The primary seed sequence for this model comes from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a photosynthetic alga.  The enzyme has been purified and characterized and these data are fully consistent with the assignment of function as a PGPase involved in photorespiration [1].
CC  The second seed, from Homo sapiens chromosome 22 has been characterized as a pyridoxal phosphatase [2].  Biochemical characterization of partially purified PGP's from various tissues including red blood cells [3] have been performed while one gene for PGP has been localized to chromosome 16p13.3 [5].  The sequence used here maps to chromosome 22.  There is indeed a related gene on chromosome 16 (and it is expressed, since EST's are found) which shows 46% identity and 59% positives by BLAST2 (E=1e-66).  The chromosome 16  gene is not in evidence in nraa but translated from the genomic sequence would score 372.4 (E=7.9e-113) versus this HMM, well above trusted.  
CC  The third seed, from C. elegans, is only supported by sequence similarity.
CC  This HMM is limited to eukaryotic species including S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, although several archaea score between the trusted and noise cutoffs.
CC  This HMM is closely related to a family of bacterial sequences including the E. coli NagD and B. subtilus AraL genes which are characterized by the ability to hydrolyze para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPPases or NPPases).  The chlamydomonas PGPase d

This enzyme is similarly related to PGP.  In this case, too it is unclear what role would be be played by a PGPase activity.

CC  This hypothetical equivalog is a member of the Class IIA subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The sequences modelled by this equivalog are all eukaryotes.
CC  One sequence (GP|13344995) is called "Cat Eye Syndrome critical region protein 5" (CECR5) [1].  This gene has been cloned from a pericentromere region of human chromosome 22 believed to be the location of the gene or genes responsible for Cat Eye Syndrome.  This is one of a number of candidate genes.
CC  The Schizosaccharomyces pombe sequence (EGAD|138276) is annotated as "phosphatidyl synthase," however this is due entirely to a C-terminal region of the protein (outside the region of similarity of this HMM) which is highly homologous to a family of CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases. (Thus, the annotation of GP|4226073 from C. elegans as similar to phosphatidyl synthase, is a mistake as this gene does not contain the C-terminal portion).  The physical connection of the phosphatidyl synthase and the HAD-superfamily hydrolase domain in S. pombe may, however, be an important clue to the substrate for the hydrolases in this equivalog.

EN  Haloacid Dehalogenase Superfamily Class (subfamily) IIA
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents one structural subclass of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs [1].
CC  The classes are defined [2] based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called "capping domain" [3], or the absence of such a domain.
CC  Class I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs.  Class II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs.  Class III sequences have no capping domain in iether of these positions.
CC  The Class IIA capping domain is predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of a mixed alpha-beta fold with the basic pattern: Helix-Helix-Helix-Sheet-Helix-Loop-Sheet-Helix-Sheet-Helix.
CC  Presently, this subfamily encompasses a single equivalog model (TIGR01452) for the eukaryotic phosphoglycolate phosphatase, as well as four hypothetical equivalogs covering closely related sequences (TIGR01456 and TIGR01458 in eukaryotes, TIGR01457 in gram positive bacteria and TIGR01459 in gram negative bacteria).
CC  The Escherishia coli NagD gene and the Bacillus subtilus AraL gene are members of this subfamily but are not members of the any of the presently defined equivalogs within it.  NagD is part of the NAG operon responsible for N-acetylglucosamine metabolism [4].  The function of this gene is unknown.  Genes from several organisms have been annotated as NagD, or NagD-like.  However, without data on the presence of other members of this pathway, (such as in the case of Yersinia pestis) these assignments should not be given great weight.  The AraL gene is similar: it is part of the L-arabinose operon, but the function is unknown [5].  A gene from Halobacterium has been annotated as AraL, but no other Ara operon genes have been annotated.
CC  Many of the genes in this subfamily have been annotated as "pNPPase" "4-nitrophenyl phosphatase" or "NPPase".  These all refer to the same activity versus a common lab test compound used to determine phosphatase activity.  There is no evidence that this activity is physiologically relevant.

This enzyme catalyzes the first step committed to the biosynthesis of either siroheme or cobalamin (vitamin B12) rather than protoheme (heme). Cobalamin contains cobalt while siroheme contains iron. Siroheme is a cofactor for nitrite and sulfite reductases and therefore plays a role in cysteine biosynthesis; many members of this family are CysG, siroheme synthase, with an additional N-terminal domain and with additional oxidation and iron insertion activities.

The C-terminal region of each is uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107), which catalyzes the first step committed to the biosynthesis of either siroheme or cobalamin (vitamin B12) rather than protoheme (heme). The region represented by this model completes the process of oxidation and iron insertion to yield siroheme. Siroheme is a cofactor for nitrite and sulfite reductases, so siroheme synthase is CysG of cysteine biosynthesis in some organisms.

Additionally, disruption of CcpA in Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus xylosus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactocacillus pentosus also decreases growth rate, which suggests CcpA is involved in the regulation of other metabolic pathways.

SPP is a member of the Class IIB subfamily (TIGR01484) of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. SPP catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of sucrose, a critically important molecule for plants. Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), the prior step in the biosynthesis of sucrose, contains a domain which exhibits considerable similarity to SPP albeit without conservation of the catalytic residues.  The catalytic machinery of the synthase resides in another domain.  It seems likely that the phosphatase-like domain is involved in substrate binding, possibly binding both substrates in a "product-like" orientation prior to ligation by the synthase catalytic domain.

Several members of this family from thermophiles (and from Dehalococcoides ethenogenes) are now known to act as mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate (MPG) phosphatase. In these cases, the enzyme acts after MPG synthase to make the compatible solute mannosylglycerate. We propose that other mesophilic members of this family do not act as  mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase. A member of this family is found in Escherichia coli, which appears to lack  MPG synthase. Mannosylglycerate is imported in E. coli by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent transporter (PMID:14645248), but it appears the phosphorylation is not on the glycerate moiety, that the phosphorylated import is degraded by an alpha-mannosidase from an adjacent gene, and that E. coli would have no pathway to obtain MPG.

Subfamily IA, B, C and D are distinguished from the rest of the superfamily by the presence of a variable domain between the first and second conserved catalytic motifs.  In subfamilies IA and IB, this domain consists of an alpha-helical bundle.  It was necessary to model these two subfamilies separately, breaking them at a an apparent phylogenetic bifurcation, so that the resulting model(s) are not so broadly defined that members of subfamily III (which lack the variable domain) are included.
CC  Subfamily IA includes the enzyme phosphoserine phosphatase (TIGR00338) as well as three hypothetical equivalogs.  Many members of these hypothetical equivalogs have been annotated as PSPase-like or PSPase-family proteins.  In particular, the hypothetical equivalog which appears to be most closely related to PSPase contains only Archaea (while TIGR00338 contains only eukaryotes and bacteria) of which some are annotated as PSPases.  Although this is a reasonable conjecture, none of these sequences has sufficient evidence for this assignment.  If such should be found, this model should be retired while the PSPase model should be broadened to include these sequences.

CC  This phosphatase is a member of the IB subfamily (TIGR01488) of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  With the exception of OMNI|NTL01BS01361 from B. subtilis and GP|15024582 from Clostridium acetabutylicum, the members of this group are all eukaryotic, spanning metazoa, plants and fungi.
CC  The B. subtilus gene (YkrX, renamed MtnX) is part of an operon for the conversion of methylthioribose (MTR) to methionine. It works with the enolase MtnW, a RuBisCO homolog. The combination of MtnW and MtnX achieves the same overall reaction as the enolase-phosphatase MtnC. The function of MtnX was shown by Ashida, et al. (2003) to be 2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane phosphatase, rather than 2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane phosphatase as proposed earlier. See the Genome Property for methionine salvage for more details. In eukaryotes, methionine salvage from methylthioadenosine also occurs. It seems reasonable that members of this family in eukaryotes fulfill a similar role as in Bacillus. A more specific, equivalog-level model is TIGR03333.
CC  Note that SP|P53981 from S. cerevisiae, a member of this family, is annotated as a "probable membrane protein" due to a predicted transmembrane helix.  The region in question contains the second of the three conserved HAD superfamily catalytic motifs and thus, considering the fold of the HAD catalytic domain, is unlikely to be a transmembrane region in fact.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents part of one structural subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs [1].  The subfamilies are defined [2] based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called 'capping domain' [3], or the absence of such a domain.  Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs.  Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs.  Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions.  
CC  The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an alpha helical bundle.  Subfamily I encompasses such a wide region of sequence space (the sequences are highly divergent) that modelling it with a single HMM is impossible, resulting in an overly broad description which allows in many unrelated sequences.  Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an aparrent phylogenetic bifurcation.  Subfamily IA is still too broad to model, but cannot be further subdivided into large chunks based on phylogenetic trees.  Of the three motifs defining the HAD superfamily, the third has three variant forms [2]: (1) hhhhsDxxx(x)D, (2) hhhhssxxx(x)D and (3) hhhhDDxxx(x)s where _s_ refers to a small amino acid and _h_ to a hydrophobic one.  All three of these variants are found in subfamily IA.  Individual HMMs were made based on seeds exhibiting only one of the variants each.  Variant 2 (this model) is distinctive of the type II haloacid dehalogenases, and nearly all of the sequences are also part of the HAD, type II equivalog model (TIGR01428).  These three variant models were created with the knowledge that there will be overlap among them - this is by design and serves the purpose of eliminating the overlap with models of more distantly related HAD subfamilies caused by an overly broad single model.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  The P-type ATPases are a large family of trans-membrane transporters acting on charged substances.  The distinguishing feature of the family is the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate (aspartyl-phosphate) during the course of the reaction.  Another common name for these enzymes is the E1-E2 ATPases based on the two isolable conformations: E1 (unphosphorylated) and E2 (phosphorylated).  Generally, P-type ATPases consist of only a single subunit encompassing the ATPase and ion translocation pathway, however, in the case of the potassium (TIGR01497) and sodium/potassium (TIGR01106) varieties, these functions are split between two subunits[5].  Additional small regulatory or stabilizing subunits may also exist in some forms.
CC  P-type ATPases are nearly ubiquitous in life and are found in numerous copies in higher organisms (at least 45 in Arabidopsis thaliana, for instance [1]).  Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the P-type ATPase subfamily is divided up into groups based on substrate specificities [2] and this is represented in the various subfamily and equivalog models that have been made: IA (K+) TIGR01497, IB (heavy metals) TIGR01525, IIA1 (SERCA-type Ca++) TIGR01116, IIA2 (PMR1-type Ca++) TIGR01522, IIB (PMCA-type Ca++) TIGR01517, IIC (Na+/K+, H+/K+ antiporters) TIGR01106, IID (fungal-type Na+ and K+) TIGR01523, IIIA (H+) TIGR01647, IIIB (Mg++) TIGR01524, IV (phospholipid, flippase) TIGR01652 and V (unknown specificity) TIGR01657.
CC  The crystal structure of one calcium-pumping ATPase [4] and an analysis of the fold of the catalytic domain of the P-type ATPases [3] have been published.  These reveal that the catalytic core of these enzymes is a haloacid dehalogenase(HAD)-type aspartate-nucleophile hydrolase.  The location of the ATP-binding loop in between the first and second HAD conserved catalytic motifs defines these enzymes as members of subfamily I of the HAD superfamily (see also TIGR01493, TIGR01509, TIGR01549, TIGR01544 and TIGR01545).  Based on these classifications, the P-type ATPase _superfamily_ corresponds to the IC subfamily of the HAD superfamily.

CC  This model describes the P-type ATPase subunit of the complex responsible for translocating potassium ions across biological membranes in microbes.  In E. coli and other species, this complex consists of the proteins KdpA, KdpB, KdpC and KdpF.  KdpB is the ATPase subunit, while KdpA is the potassium-ion translocating subunit[1].  The function of KdpC is unclear, although cit has been suggested to couple the ATPase subunit to the ion-translocating subunit [2], while KdpF serves to stabilize the complex [3].
CC  The potassium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IA based on a phylogenetic analysis which places this clade closest to the heavy-metal translocating ATPases (Type IB) [4].  Others place this clade closer to the Na+/K+ antiporter type (Type IIC) based on physical characteristics [1].
CC  This model is very clear-cut, with a strong break between trusted hits and noise.  All members of the seed alignment, from Clostridium, Anabaena and E. coli are in the characterized table.  One sequence above trusted, OMNI|NTL01TA01282, is apparently mis-annotated in the primary literature, but properly annotated by TIGR.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents part of one structural subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs [1].  The subfamilies are defined [2] based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called "capping domain" [3], or the absence of such a domain.  Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs.  Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs.  Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions.
CC  The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an alpha helical bundle.  Subfamily I encompasses such a wide region of sequence space (the sequences are highly divergent) that modelling it with a single HMM is impossible, resulting in an overly broad description which allows in many unrelated sequences.  Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an aparrent phylogenetic bifurcation.  Subfamily IA is still too broad to model, but cannot be further subdivided into large chunks based on phylogenetic trees.  Of the three motifs defining the HAD superfamily, the third has three variant forms [2]: (1) hhhhsDxxx(x)D, (2) hhhhssxxx(x)D and (3) hhhhDDxxx(x)s where _s_ refers to a small amino acid and _h_ to a hydrophobic one.  All three of these variants are found in subfamily IA.  Individual HMMs were made based on seeds exhibiting only one of the variants each.  Variant 3 (this model) is found in the enzymes beta-phosphoglucomutase (TIGR01990) and deoxyglucose-6-phosphatase, while many other enzymes of subfamily IA exhibit this variant as well as variant 1 (TIGR01549).  These three variant models were created with the knowledge that there will be overlap among them - this is by design and serves the purpose of eliminating the overlap with models of more distantly related HAD subfamilies caused by an overly broad single model.

CC  This HMM describes pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase, the penultimate enzyme of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in bacteria. It does not show any strong homology to eukaryotic enzymes of coenzyme A biosynthesis. This protein was previously designated KdtB and postulated (because of cytidyltransferase homology and proximity to kdtA) to be an enzyme of LPS biosynthesis, a cytidyltransferase for 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid. However, no activity toward that compound was found with either CTP or ATP. The phylogenetic distribution of this enzyme is more consistent with coenzyme A biosynthesis than with LPS biosynthesis.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model describes the P-type ATPase primarily responsible for translocating copper ions accross biological membranes.  These transporters are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  This model encompasses those species which pump copper ions out of cells or organelles (efflux pumps such as CopA of Escherichia coli [1]) as well as those which pump the ion into cells or organelles either for the purpose of supporting life in extremely low-copper environments (for example CopA of Enterococcus hirae [2]) or for the specific delivery of copper to a biological complex for which it is a necessary component (for example FixI of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, or CtaA and PacS of Synechocystis [3]).  The substrate specificity of these transporters may, to a varying degree, include silver ions (for example, CopA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus [4]).
CC  Copper transporters from this family are well known as the genes which are mutated in two human disorders of copper metabolism, Wilson's and Menkes' diseases [5].
CC  The sequences contributing to the seed of this model are all experimentally characterized.
CC  The copper P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IB based on a phylogenetic analysis which combines the copper-translocating ATPases with the cadmium-translocating species [6].  This HMM and that describing the cadmium-ATPases (TIGR01512) are well separated, and thus we further type the copper-ATPases as IB1 (and the cadmium-ATPases as IB2).
CC  Several sequences which have not been characterized experimentally fall just below the cutoffs for both of these models (SP|Q9CCL1 from Mycobacterium leprae, GP|13816263 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, OMNI|NTL01CJ01098 from Campylobacter jejuni, OMNI|NTL01HS01687 from Halobacterium sp., GP|6899169 from Ureaplasma urealyticum and OMNI|HP1503  from Helicobacter pylori).
CC  Accession PIR|A29576 from Enterococcus faecalis scores very high against this model, but yet is annotated as an "H+/K+ exchanging ATPase".  BLAST of this sequence does not hit anything else annotated in this way.  This error may come from the characterization paper published in 1987 [7].
CC  Accession GP|7415611 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to be mis-annotated as a cadmium resistance protein.
CC  Accession OMNI|NTL01HS00542 from Halobacterium which scores above trusted for this model is annotated as "molybdenum-binding protein" although no evidence can be found for this classification.

This HMM represents the other family. Members have a different (longer) spacing of several key motifs and have an additional C-terminal domain of up to 100 residues. One argument suggesting that this family represents the same enzyme is that no species has a member of both families. Another is that the gene encoding this protein is located near other NAD salvage biosynthesis genes in Nostoc and in at least four different Gram-positive bacteria. NAD and NADP are ubiquitous in life.
CC  Most members of this family are Gram-positive bacteria. An additional set of mutually closely related archaeal sequences score between the trusted and noise cutoffs.

CC  This enzyme is a member of the broader amylase family of starch hydrolases which fold as (beta/alpha)8 barrels, the so-called TIM-barrel structure [1,2].
CC  All of the sequences comprising the seed of this model have been experimentally characterized. (For instance, [3]).
CC  This model encompasses both bacterial and eukaryotic species.  No archaea have this enzyme, although Aquifex aolicus does.
CC  Two species, Bacillus thuringiensis and Clostridium perfringens have two sequences each which are annotated as amylases.  These annotations are aparrently in error.  GP|18143720 from C. perfringens, for instance, contains the note "674 aa, similar to gp:A14658_1 amylase (1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18) ) from Bacillus thuringiensis (648 aa); 51.1% identity in 632 aa overlap."
CC  A branching enzyme from Porphyromonas gingivales, OMNI|PG1793, appears to be more closely related to the eukaryotic species (across a deep phylogenetic split) and may represent an instance of lateral transfer from this species' host.
CC  A sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana, GP|9294564, scores just above trusted, but appears either to contain corrupt sequence or, more likely, to be a pseudogene as some of the conserved catalytic residues common to the alpha amylase family are not conserved here.

CC  This model describes the P-type ATPase responsible for translocating calcium ions across the plasma membrane of eukaryotes [1], out of the cell.  In some organisms, this type of pump may also be found in vacuolar membranes [2].
CC  In humans and mice, at least, there are multiple isoforms of the PMCA pump with overlapping but not redundant functions.  Accordingly, there are no human diseases linked to PMCA defects, although alterations of PMCA function do elicit physiological effects [3].
CC  The calcium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IIB based on a phylogenetic analysis which distinguishes this group from the Type IIA SERCA calcium pump [4].  A separate analysis divides Type IIA into sub-types (SERCA and PMR1) [5] which are modelled by two corresponding HMMs (TIGR01116 and TIGR01522).  This HMM is well separated from those.

The NadR homologs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Haemophilus influenzae, and others appear to lack the repressor domain. NadR has recently been shown to act as an enzyme of the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis, nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase; members of this family are presumed to share this activity.

CC  glycogen debranching enzyme possesses two different catalytic activities; oligo-1,4-->1,4-glucantransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) and amylo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33). Site directed mutagenesis studies in S. cerevisiae [1] indicate that the transferase and glucosidase activities are independent and located in different regions of the polypeptide chain. Proteins in this model belong to the larger alpha-amylase family. The model covers eukaryotic proteins with a seed composed of human, nematode and yeast sequences. Yeast seed sequence is well characterized. The model is quite rigorous; either query sequence yields large bit score or it fails to hit the model altogether. There doesn't appear to be any middle ground.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents the small clade of dehydrogenases in gamma-proteobacteria which utilize NAD+ to oxidize erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate, a precursor for the de novo synthesis of pyridoxine  via 4-hydroxythreonine and D-1-deoxyxylulose [1].  This enzyme activity appears to have evolved from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose substrate differs only in the lack of one carbon relative to E4P.
CC  Accordingly, this model is very close to the corresponding models for GAPDH, and those sequences which hit above trusted here invariably hit between trusted and noise to the GAPDH model (TIGR01534).  Similarly, it may be found that there are species outside of the gamma proteobacteria which synthesize pyridoxine and have more than one aparrent GAPDH gene of which one may have E4PD activity - this may necessitate a readjustment of these models.  Alternatively, some of the GAPDH enzymes may prove to be bifunctional in certain species.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.  Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59).  In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively [1].
CC  Two PFAM models cover the two functional domains of this protein; PF00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and PF02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain.
CC  An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine [2].  This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria [3].  This enzyme is described by TIGR001532.  These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship.  There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity [4]).
CC  There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences.  It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model.
CC  The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

EN  haloacid dehalogenase superfamily, subfamily IA hydrolase, TIGR01548
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a small and phylogenetically curious clade of sequences.  Sequences are found from Halobacterium (an archaeon), Nostoc and Synechococcus (cyanobacteria) and Phytophthora (a stramenophile eukaryote).  These appear to be members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases by general homology and the conservation of all of the recognized catalytic motifs [1].  The variable domain is found in between motifs 1 and 2, indicating membership in subfamily I and phylogeny and prediction of the alpha helical nature of the variable domain (by PSI-PRED) indicate membership in subfamily IA.
CC  All but the Halobacterium sequence currently found are annotated as "Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase", however, the source of the annotation could not be traced and significant homology could not be found between any of these sequences and known IGPD's.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents part of one structural subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs [1].  The subfamilies are defined [2] based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called "capping domain" [3], or the absence of such a domain.  Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs.  Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs.  Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions.
CC  The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an alpha helical bundle.  Subfamily I encompasses such a wide region of sequence space (the sequences are highly divergent) that modelling it with a single HMM is impossible, resulting in an overly broad description which allows in many unrelated sequences.  Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an aparrent phylogenetic bifurcation.  Subfamily IA is still too broad to model, but cannot be further subdivided into large chunks based on phylogenetic trees.  Of the three motifs defining the HAD superfamily, the third has three variant forms [2]: (1) hhhhsDxxx(x)(D/E), (2) hhhhssxxx(x)D and (3) hhhhDDxxx(x)s where _s_ refers to a small amino acid and _h_ to a hydrophobic one.  All three of these variants are found in subfamily IA.  Individual HMMs were made based on seeds exhibiting only one of the variants each.  Variant 1 (this model) is found in the enzymes phosphoglycolate phosphatase (TIGR01449) and enolase-phosphatase.  These three variant models (see also TIGR01493 and TIGR01509) were created with
CC  the knowledge that there will be overlap among them - this is by design and serves the purpose of eliminating the overlap with models of more distantly related
CC  HAD subfamilies caused by an overly broad single model.

The holo-enzyme also contains beta and gamma subunits of 32 and 20 kDa.
CC  The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of formate (produced from pyruvate during anaerobic growth) to carbon dioxide with the concomitant release of two electrons and two protons.  The electrons are utilized mainly in the nitrate respiration by nitrate reductase [1].
CC  In E. coli and Salmonella, there are two forms of the formate dehydrogenase, one induced by nitrate which is strictly anaerobic (fdn), and one incuced during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth (fdo).  This subunit is one of only three proteins in E. coli which contain selenocysteine [2].

However it is notable that A. aeolicus also has a sequence scoring above trusted to the alpha subunit of formate dehydrogenase (TIGR01553).

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents homologs of the MiaB enzyme responsible for the modification of the isopentenylated adenine-37 base of most bacterial and eukaryotic tRNAs that read codons beginning with uracil (all except tRNA(I,V) Ser).  Adenine-37 is next to the anticodon on the 3' side in these tRNA's, and lack of modification at this site leads to an increased spontaneous mutation frequency.  Isopentenylated A-37 is modified by methylthiolation at position 2, either by MiaB alone or in concert with a separate methylase yet to be discovered (MiaC?) [1].
CC  MiaB contains a 4Fe-4S cluster which is labile under oxidizing conditions [2].  Additionally, the sequence is homologous (via PSI-BLAST searches) to the biotin synthetase, BioB, which utilizes both an iron-sulfur cluster and S-adenosym methionine (SAM) to generate a radical which is responsible for initiating the insertion of sulfur into the substrate [3].  It is reasonable to surmise that the methyl group of SAM becomes the methyl group of the product, but this has not been shown, and the possibility of a separate methylase exists.
CC  This equivalog is a member of a subfamily (TIGR00089) which contains several other hypothetical equivalogs which are all probably enzymes with similar function acting on different substrates.  These enzymes contain a TRAM domain (PF01938, [3]) which is believed to be responsible for binding to tRNAs.
CC  Hits to this model span all major groups of bacteria and eukaryotes, but not archaea, which are known to lack this particular tRNA modification.  The enzyme from Thermotoga maritima has been cloned, expressed, spectroscopically characterized and shown to complement the E. coli MiaB enzyme [4].

CC  The Nitrate reductase enzyme complex allows bacteria to use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The enzyme complex consists of a tetramer that has an alpha, beta and 2 gamma subunits. The alpha and beta subunits have catalytic activity and the gamma subunits attach the enzyme to the membrane and is a b-type cytochrome that receives electrons from the quinone pool and transfers them to the beta subunit. This model is specific for the alpha subunit for nitrate reductase I (narG) and nitrate reductase II (narZ) for gram positive and gram negative bacteria.A few thermophiles and archaea also match the model The seed members used to make the model include Nitrate reductases from Pseudomonas fluorescens (GP:11344601), E.coli (SP:P09152) and B.subtilis (SP:P42175). All seed members are experimentally characterized. Some unpublished nitrate reductases, that are shorter sequences, and probably fragments fall in between the noise and trusted cutoffs. Pfam models PF00384 (Molybdopterin oxidoreductase) and PF01568(Molydopterin dinucleotide binding domain) will also match the nitrate reductase, alpha subunit.

CC  This model describes a clade of ABC porter genes with relatively weak homology compared to its neighbor clades, the molybdate (TIGR02141) and sulfate (TIGR00969) porters.  Neighbor-Joining, PAM-distance  phylogenetic trees support the separation of the clades in this way.
CC  Included in this group is a gene designated NifC in Clostridium pasturianum [1].  It would be reasonable to presume that NifC acts as a molybdate porter since the most common form of nitrogenase is a molybdoenzyme.  Several other sequences falling within the scope of this model are annotated as molybdate porters and one, from Halobacterium, is annotated as a sulfate porter.  There is presently no experimental evidence to support annotations with this degree of specificity.

The seed was generated from a list of ORF's in P. yoelii containing a paralagous domain as defined by an algorithm implemented at TIFR [1].

In between trusted and noise is one gene from P. vivax (vir25) which has been characterized as a distant relative of the yir/bir/cir family [2].  The vir family [3] appears to be present in 600-1000 copies per haploid genome and is preferentially located in the sub-telomeric regions of the chromosomes.  The genomic data for yoelii is consistent with this observation.  It is not believed that there are any orthologs of this family in P. falciparum.

CC  This is a model of the acyl carrier protein (aka gamma subunit) of the holoenzyme citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.6) composed of alpha (EC 2.8.3.10), beta (EC 4.1.3.34), and acyl carrier protein subunits in a stoichiometric relationship of 6:6:6. Citrate lyase is an enzyme which converts citrate to oxaloacetate. In bacteria, this reaction is involved in citrate fermentation. The acyl carrier protein covalently binds the coenzyme of citrate lyase. The seed contains an experimentally characterized member from Leuconostoc mesenteroides [1]. The model covers a wide range of Gram positive bacteria. For Gram negative bacteria, it appears that only gamma proteobacteria hit this model. The model is quite robust with queries scoring either quite well or quite poorly against the model. There are currently no hits in-between the noise cutoff and trusted cutoff.

CC  This HMM represents a putative zinc finger domain found in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana has at least 10 distinct members. Proteins containing this domain, including LRP1, generally share the same size, about 300 amino acids, and architecture. This 43-residue domain, and a more C-terminal companion domain of similar size, appear as tightly conserved islands of sequence similarity. The remainder consists largely of low-complexity sequence. Several animal proteins have regions with matching patterns of Cys, Gly, and His residues. These are not included in the model but score between trusted and noise cutoffs.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model describes Pseudomonas denitrificans CobS gene product, which is a cobalt chelatase subunit that functions in cobalamin biosynthesis. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) can be synthesized via several pathways, including an aerobic pathway (found in Pseudomonas denitrificans) and an anaerobic pathway (found in P. shermanii and Salmonella typhimurium).  These pathways differ in the point of cobalt insertion during corrin ring formation [1].  There are apparently a number of variations on these two pathways, where the major differences seem to be concerned with the process of ring contraction [2]. Confusion regarding the functions of enzymes found in the aerobic vs. anaerobic pathways has arisen because nonhomologous genes in these different pathways were given the same gene symbols.  Thus, cobS in the aerobic pathway (P. denitrificans) is not a homolog of cobS in the anaerobic pathway  (S. typhimurium). It should be noted that E. coli synthesizes cobalamin only when it is supplied with the precursor cobinamide, which is a complex intermediate.  Additionally, all E. coli cobalamin synthesis genes (cobU, cobS and cobT) were named after their Salmonella typhimurium homologs which function in the anaerobic cobalamin synthesis pathway [3].
CC  This model describes the aerobic cobalamin pathway Pseudomonas denitrificans CobS gene product, which is a cobalt chelatase subunit, with a MW ~37 kDa [4].  The aerobic pathway cobalt chelatase is a heterotrimeric, ATP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes cobalt insertion during cobalamin biosynthesis.  The other two subunits are the P. denitrificans CobT (TIGR01651) and CobN (PF02514 CobN/Magnesium Chelatase) proteins. To avoid potential confusion with the nonhomologous Salmonella typhimurium/E.coli cobS gene product, the  P. denitrificans gene symbol is not used in the name of this model.

CC  This model describes Pseudomonas denitrificans CobT gene product, which is a cobalt chelatase subunit that functions in cobalamin biosynthesis.  Cobalamin (vitamin B12) can be synthesized via several pathways, including an aerobic pathway (found in Pseudomonas denitrificans) and an anaerobic pathway (found in P. shermanii and Salmonella typhimurium).  These pathways differ in the point of cobalt insertion during corrin ring formation [1].  There are apparently a number of variations on these two pathways, where the major differences seem to be concerned with the process of ring contraction [2]. Confusion regarding the functions of enzymes found in the aerobic vs. anaerobic pathways has arisen because nonhomologous genes in these different pathways were given the same gene symbols.  Thus, cobT in the aerobic pathway (P. denitrificans) is not a homolog of cobT in the anaerobic pathway  (S. typhimurium). It should be noted that E. coli synthesizes cobalamin only when it is supplied with the precursor cobinamide, which is a complex intermediate.  Additionally, all E. coli cobalamin synthesis genes (cobU, cobS and cobT) were named after their Salmonella typhimurium homologs which function in the anaerobic cobalamin synthesis pathway [3].
CC  This model describes the aerobic cobalamin pathway Pseudomonas denitrificans CobT gene product, which is a cobalt chelatase subunit, with a MW ~70 kDa [4].  The aerobic pathway cobalt chelatase is a heterotrimeric, ATP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes cobalt insertion during cobalamin biosynthesis.  The other two subunits are the P. denitrificans CobS (TIGR01650) and CobN (PF02514 CobN/Magnesium Chelatase) proteins. To avoid potential confusion with the nonhomologous Salmonella typhimurium/E.coli cobT gene product, the  P. denitrificans gene symbol is not used in the name of this model.

This superfamily is distinguished by the presence of three motifs: an N-terminal motif containing the nucleophilic aspartate, a central motif containing an conserved serine or threonine, and a C-terminal motif containing a conserved lysine (or arginine) and conserved aspartates.  More specifically, the domian modelled here is a member of subfamily III of the HAD-superfamily by virtue of lacking a "capping" domain in either of the two common positions, between motifs 1 and 2, or between motifs 2 and 3.

CC  The Nitrate reductase enzyme complex allows bacteria to use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The enzyme complex consists of a tetramer that has an alpha, beta and 2 gamma subunits. The alpha and beta subunits have catalytic activity and the gamma subunits attach the enzyme to the membrane and is a b-type cytochrome that receives electrons from the quinone pool and transfers them to the beta subunit. This model is specific for the beta subunit for nitrate reductase I (narH) and nitrate reductase II (narY) for gram positive and gram negative bacteria.A few thermophiles and archaea also match the model.The seed members used in this model are all experimentally characterized and include the following:SP:P11349, and SP:P19318, both E.Coli (NarH and NarY respectively), SP:P42176 from B.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This subfamily falls within the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The Class III subfamilies are characterized by the lack of any domains located between either between the first and second conserved catalytic motifs (as in the Class I subfamilies, TIGR01493, TIGR01509, TIGR01488 and TIGR01494) or between the second and third conserved catalytic motifs (as in the Class II subfamilies, TIGR01460 and TIGR01484) of the superfamily domain.  The IIIA subfamily contains five major clades: histidinol-phosphatase (TIGR01261, [3]) and histidinol-phosphatase-related protein (TIGR00213) which together form a subfamily (TIGR01656), DNA 3'-phosphatase (TIGR01663, TIGR01664), YqeG (TIGR01668) and YrbI (TIGR01670).  
CC  In the case of histidinol phosphatase and PNK-3'-phosphatase, this model represents a domain of a bifunctional system.  In the histidinol phosphatase HisB, a C-terminal domain is an imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase which catalyzes a related step in histidine biosynthesis.  In PNK-3'-phosphatase, N- and C-terminal domains constitute the polynucleotide kinase and DNA-binding components of the enzyme.

CC  This model represents the metazoan 5'-polynucleotide-kinase-3'-phosphatase, PNKP, which is believed to be involved in repair of oxidative DNA damage.  Removal of 3' phosphates is essential for the further processing of the break by DNA polymerases [1,2].  
CC  The central phosphatase domain is a member of the IIIA subfamily (TIGR01662) of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  As is common in this superfamily, the enzyme is magnesium dependent.  A difference between this enzyme and other HAD-superfamily phosphatases is in the third conserved catalytic motif which usually contains two conserved aspartate residues believed to be involved in binding the magnesium ion.  Here, the second aspartate is replaced by a conserved arginine residue which may indicate an interaction with the phosphate backbone of the substrate.
CC  Very close relatives of this domain are also found separate from the N- and C-terminal domains seen here, as in the 3'-phosphatase found in plants.  The larger family of these domains is described by TIGR01664.
CC  Outside of the phosphatase domain is a P-loop ATP-binding motif associated with the kinase activity.
CC  The entry for the mouse homolog, GP|7108591, appears to be missing a large piece of sequence corresponding to the first conserved catalytic motif of the phosphatase domain as well as the conserved threonine of the second motif.  Either this is a sequencing artifact or this may represent a pseudo- or non-functional gene.

CC  This family of proteins is a member of the IIIA subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases.  All characterized members of this subfamily (TIGR01662) and most characterized members of the HAD superfamily are phosphatases.  HAD superfamily phosphatases contain active site residues in several conserved catalytic motifs [1], all of which are found conserved here.
CC  One member of this family, the YrbI protein from H. influenzae has been cloned, expressed, purified and found to be an active 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphatase[2].  Furthermore, its crystal structure has been determined [3].
CC  This family consists of sequences from beta, gamma and epsilon proteobacteria, Aquifex, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas and Methanosarcina.  
CC  The Methanosarcina sequence is distinctive in that it is linked to an N-terminal cytidylyltransferase domain (PF02348) and is annotated as acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase.  This may give some clue as the function of these phosphatases.  Several eukaryotic  sequences scoring between trusted and noise are also closely related to this function such as the CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase from mouse, but in these cases the phosphatase domain is clearly inactive as many of the active site residues are not conserved.

CC  This family of proteins is a member of the IIIB subfamily (PF02767) of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases.  All characterized members of subfamily III and most characterized members of the HAD superfamily are phosphatases.  HAD superfamily phosphatases contain active site residues in several conserved catalytic motifs [1], all of which are found conserved here.
CC  The AphA gene from E. coli has been characterized and shown to be an active phosphatase enzyme [2].  This family has been previously described as the "class B non-specific bacterial acid phosphatase" (B-NSAP) family [3] where it is noted that the enzyme is secreted and has a broad substrate range.  The possibility exists, however, that the enzyme is specific for an as yet undefined substrate.
CC  Supporting evidence for the inclusion in the HAD superfamily, whose phosphatase members are magnesium dependent, is the inhibition by EDTA and calcium ions, and stimulation by magnesium ion [3].

EN  plant acid phosphatase
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents a family of acid phosphatase [1,2] from plants which are most closely related to the (so called) class B non-specific acid phosphatase OlpA (TIGR01533, which is believed to be a 5'-nucleotide phosphatase) and somewhat more distantly to another class B phosphatase, AphA (TIGR01672).  Together these three clades define a subfamily (PF03767) which corresponds to the IIIB subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate nucleophile hydrolases.
CC  It has been reported that the best substrate for this enzyme that could be found was purine 5'-nucleoside phosphates [1].  This is in concordance with the assignment of the H. influenzae hel protein (from TIGR01533) as a 5'-nucleotidase, however there is presently no other evidence to support this specific function for these plant phosphatases.
CC  Many genes from this family have been annotated as vegetative storage proteins due to their close homology with these earlier-characterized gene products [3] which are highly expressed in leaves.  There are significant differences however, including expression levels and distribution [4].  The most important difference is the lack in authentic VSPs of the nucleophilic aspartate residue, which is instead replaced by serine, glycine or asparagine.  Thus these proteins can not be expected to be active phosphatases.  This issue was confused by the publication in 1992 of an article claiming activity for the Glycine max VSP [5].  In 1994 this assertion was refuted by the separation of the activity from the VSP [6].
CC  This model explicitly excludes the VSPs which lack the nucleophilc aspartate.  The possibility exists, however, that some members of this family may, while containing all of the conserved HAD-superfamily catalytic residues, lack activity and have a function related to the function of the VSPs rather than the acid phosphatases.

Subfamily III (also including IIIA - TIGR01662 and IIIB - PF03767) contains sequences which do not contain either of the insert domains (between the 1st and 2nd conserved catalytic motifs, subfamily I - TIGR01493, TIGR01509, TIGR01549, TIGR01488, TIGR01494, TIGR01658, TIGR01544 and TIGR01545, or between the 2nd and 3rd, subfamily II - TIGR01460 and TIGR01484).  Subfamily IIIC contains five relatively distantly related clades: a family of viral proteins (TIGR01684), a family of eukaryotic proteins called MDP-1 and a family of archaeal proteins most closely related to MDP-1 (TIGR01685), a family of bacteria including the Streptomyces FkbH protein (TIGR01686), and a small clade including the Pasteurella BcbF and EcbF proteins.  The overall lack of species overlap among these clades may indicate a conserved function, but the degree of divergence between the clades and the differences in archetecture outside of the domain in some clades warns against such a conclusion.
CC  No member of this subfamily is characterized with respect to function, however the MDP-1 protein [1] is a characterized phosphatase.

CC  This model describes a domain of a family of proteins of unknown overall function.  One of these, however, is a modular polyketide synthase 4800 amino acids in length from Streptomyces avermilitis in which this domain is the C-terminal segment.  By contrast, the FkbH protein from Streptomyces hygroscopicus aparently contains only this domain.  The remaining members of the family all contain an additional N-terminal domain of between 200 and 275 amino acids which show less than 20% identity to one another.  It seems likely then that these proteins are involved in disparate functions, probably the biosynthesis of different natural products.  For instance, the FkbH gene is found in a gene cluster believed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of unususal "PKS extender units" in the ascomycin pathway [2].
CC  This domain is composed of two parts, the first of which is a member of subfamily IIIC (TIGR01681) of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  All of the characterized enzymes within subfamily III are phosphatases, and all of the active site residues characteristic of HAD-superfamily phosphatases [1] are present in this domain.

CC  This model describes a small family of highly conserved proteins (>60% ID).  Two of these, BcbF and EcbF of Pasteurella multocida are believed to be part of the capsule polysaccharide biosynthesis machinery because they are cotranscribed from a locus devoted to that purpose [1].  In pasteurella there are six different variant capsules (A-F), and these proteins are found only in B and E.  The other two species in which this gene is (currently) found are both also pathogenic.  
CC  These proteins are also members of the IIIC (TIGR01681) subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  All of the characterized enzymes within subfamily III are phosphatases, and all of the active site residues characteristic of HAD-superfamily phosphatases [2] are present in this subfamily.
CC  Due to the likelihood that the substrates of these enzymes are different depending on the nature of the particular polysaccharides associated with each species, this model has been classified as a subfamily despite the close homology.

CC  This enzyme is the enolase-phosphatase of methionine salvage, a pathway that regenerates methionine from methylthioadenosine (MTA). Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is a donor of different moieties for various processes, including methylation reactions. Use of AdoMet for spermidine biosynthesis, which leads to polyamine biosynthesis, leaves MTA as a by-product that must be cleared. In Bacillus subtilis and related species, this single protein is replaced by separate enzymes with enolase and phosphatase activities.

CC  3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate to methylmalonate semialdehyde of the valine catabolism pathway.
CC  In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (mmsB) is co-induced with methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (mmsA) when grown on medium containing valine as the sole carbon source. The positive transcriptional regulator of this operon (mmsR) is located upstream of these genes and has been identified as a member of the XylS/AraC family of transcriptional regulators [1].
CC  3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase shares high sequence homology to the characterized 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase from rat liver [2] with conservation of proposed NAD+ binding residues at the N-terminus (G-8,10,13,24 and D-31).
CC  This enzyme belongs to the 3-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, sharing a common evolutionary origin and enzymatic mechanism with 6-phosphogluconate [3]. HIBADH exhibits sequence similarity to the NAD binding domain of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase above trusted (PF03446).

CC  This model represents the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase found in metazoa, cyanobacteria and a limited number of archaea such as Sulfolobus, Aeropyrum, Pyrobaculum, Pyrococcus, and Thermoplasma.  This enzyme is responsible for the first step in the methionine salvage pathway after the transfer of the amino acid moiety from S-adenosylmethionine.  
CC  The enzyme from human is well-characterized including a crystal structure [1,2].  A misleading characterization is found for a Sulfolobus solfataricus enzyme [3] which is called a MTAP.  In fact, as uncovered by the genome sequence of S. solfataricus, there are at least two nucleotide phosphorylases and the one found in the MTAP clade is not the one annotated as such.  The sequence in this clade has not been isolated but is likely to be the authentic SsMTAP as it displays all of the conserved active site residues found in the human enzyme [2].  This explains the finding that the characterized enzyme has greater efficiency towards the purines inosine, guanosine and adenosine over MTA.  In fact, this mis-naming of this enzyme has been carried forward to several publications including a crystal stucture [4].
CC  In between the trusted and noise cutoffs are: 1) several archaeal sequences which appear to contain several residues characteristic of phosphorylases which act on guanosine or inosine (according to the crystal structure of MTAP and alignments).  In any case, these residues are not conserved.  2) sequences from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptomyces coelicolor which have better, although not perfect retention of the active site residues, but considering the general observation that bacteria utilize the MTA/SAH nucleotidase enzyme and a kinase to do this reaction, these have been excluded pending stronger evidence of their function, and 3) a sequence from Drosophila which appears to be a recent divergence (long branch in neighbor-joining trees) and lacks some of the conserved active site residues.

CC  This model is a subset of the subfamily represented by PF00896 (phosphorylase family 2).  This model excludes the methylthioadenosine phosphorylases (MTAP, TIGR01684) which are believed toplay a specific role in the recycling of methionine from methylthioadenosine.  In this subfamily is found three clades of purine phosphorylases based on a neighbor-joining tree using the MTAP family as an outgroup.  
CC  The highest-branching clade (TIGR01698) consists of a group of sequences from both gram positive and gram negative bacteria which have been annotated as purine nucleotide phosphorylases but have not been further characterized as to substrate specificity.
CC  Of the two remaining clades, one is xanthosine phosphorylase (XAPA, TIGR01699), is limited to certain gamma proteobacteria and constitutes a special purine phosphorylase found in a specialized operon for xanthosine catabolism.  The enzyme also acts on the same purines (inosine and guanosine) as the other characterized members of this subfamily, but is only induced when xanthosine must be degraded. 
CC  The remaining and largest clade consists of purine nucleotide phosphorylases (PNPH, TIGR01700) from metazoa and bacteria which act primarily on guanosine and inosine (and do not act on adenosine).
CC  Sequences from Clostridium (GP:15025051) and Thermotoga (OMNI:TM1596) fall between these last two clades and are uncharacterized with respect to substrate range and operon.

In the case of 5'-methylthioadenosine this represents the first step of the methionine salvage pathway in bacteria [1,2,3].  This enzyme is widely distributed in bacteria.

CC  This model represents the large subunit of a family of nitrate reductases found in proteobacteria which are localized to the periplasm.  This subunit binds molybdopterin and contains a twin-arginine motif at the N-terminus.  The protein associates with NapB, a soluble heme-containing protein and NapC, a membrane-bound cytochrome c.
CC  The periplasmic nitrate reductases are not involved in the assimilation of nitrogen, and are not directly involved in the formation of electrochemical gradients (i.e. respiration) either.  Rather, the purpose of this enzyme is either dissimilatory (i.e. to dispose of excess reductive equivalents) or indirectly respiratory by virtue of the consumption of electrons derived from NADH via the proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase [4].
CC  The enzymes from Alicagenes eutrophus [1] and Paracoccus pantotrophus [2] have been characterized.  In E. coli [3] (as well as other organisms) this gene is part of a large nitrate reduction operon (napFDAGHBC).

A clade including second sequences from Halobacterium and Vibrio was somewhat more distantly related and may represent a slightly different substrate specificity - these were placed below the noise cutoff.  More distantly related is a clade of archaeal sequences which as related to the DeoD family of inosine phosphorylases (TIGR00107) as they are to these uridine phosphorylases.  This clade includes a characterized protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus which has been mis-named as a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, but which acts on inosine and guanosine - it is unclear whether uridine has been evaluated as a substrate [4].

The converse is not true, PF00668 domains are not always followed by this domain.  This implicates this domain in possible post-condensation modification events.

CC  Involved in valine catabolism, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalyzes the irreversible NAD+- and CoA-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of methylmalonate semialdehyde to propionyl-CoA [1].
CC  Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase has been characterized in both prokaryotes [1,2] and eukaryotes [3], functioning as a mammalian tetramer and a bacterial homodimer. Although similar in monomeric molecular mass and enzymatic activity, the N-terminal sequence in P.aeruginosa does not correspond with the N-terminal sequence predicted for rat liver [1].
CC  Sequence homology to a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases places MMSDH in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) superfamily (PF00171), making MMSDH's CoA requirement unique among known ALDHs. Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase is closely related to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and class 1 and 2 aldehyde dehydrogenase [3].
CC  In Bacillus, a highly homologous protein to methylmalonic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase, groups out from the main MMSDH clade with Listeria and Sulfolobus. This Bacillus protein has been suggested to be located in an iol operon and/or involved in myo-inositol catabolism, converting malonic semialdehyde to acetyl CoA ad CO2 [4]. The preceeding enzymes responsible for valine catabolism are present in Bacillus, Listeria, and Sulfolobus.

Transport systems for taurine (NH2-CH2-CH2-SO3H), sulfonates, and sulfate esters import sulfur when sulfate levels are low. The most closely related proteins outside this family are putative aliphatic sulfonate binding proteins (TIGR01728).

CC  This HMM represents the MFP (membrane fusion protein) component of the RND family of transporters. RND refers to Resistance, Nodulation, and cell Division. It is, in part, a subfamily of PF00529 (Pfam release 7.5) but hits substantial numbers of proteins missed by that HMM.  The related HlyD secretion protein, for which PF00529 is named, is outside the scope of this model. Attributed functions imply outward transport. These functions include nodulation, acriflavin resistance, heavy metal efflux, and multidrug resistance proteins. Most members of this family are found in Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed function of MFP proteins is to bring the inner and outer membranes together and enable transport to the outside of the outer membrane. Note, however, that a few members of this family are found in Gram-positive bacteria, where there is no outer membrane.

EN  amino acid adenylation domain
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents a domain responsible for the specific recognition of amino acids and activation as adenylyl amino acids.  The reaction catalyzed is aa + ATP -> aa-AMP + PPi.
CC  These domains are usually found as components of multi-domain non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and are usually called "A-domains" in that context (for a review, see [1]).  A-domains are almost invariably followed by "T-domains" (thiolation domains, PF00550) to which the amino acid adenylate is transferred as a thiol-ester to a bound pantetheine cofactor with the release of AMP (these are also called peptide carrier proteins, or PCPs.  When the A-domain does not represent the first module (corresponding to the first amino acid in the product molecule) it is usually preceded by a "C-domain" (condensation domain, PF00668) which catalyzes the ligation of two amino acid thiol-esters from neighboring modules.
CC  This domain is a subset of the AMP-binding domain found in Pfam (PF00501) which also hits substrate--CoA ligases and luciferases.  Sequences scoring in between trusted and noise for this model may be ambiguous as to whether they activate amino acids or other molecules lacking an alpha amino group.

CC  This model includes the terminal domain from the fungal alpha aminoadipate reductase enzyme (also known as aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) which is involved in the biosynthesis of lysine [1],  as well as the reductase-containing component of the myxochelin biosynthetic gene cluster, MxcG [2].  
CC  The mechanism of reduction involves activation of the substrate by adenylation and transfer to a covalently-linked pantetheine cofactor as a thioester.  This thioester is then reduced to give an aldehyde (thus releasing the product) and a regenerated pantetheine thiol [3].  (In myxochelin biosynthesis this aldehyde is further reduced to an alcohol or converted to an amine by an aminotransferase.)  This is a fundamentally different reaction than beta-ketoreductase domains of polyketide synthases which act at a carbonyl two carbons removed from the thioester and forms an alcohol as a product.
CC  This domain is invariably found at the C-terminus of the proteins which contain it (presumably because it results in the release of the product).  The majority of hits to this model are non-ribosomal peptide synthetases in which this domain is similarly located proximal to a thiolation domain (PF00550).  In some cases this domain is found at the end of a polyketide synthetase enzyme, but is unlike ketoreductase domains which are found before the thiolase domains.  Exceptions to this observed relationship with the thiolase domain include three proteins which consist of stand-alone reductase domains (GP|466833 from M. leprae, GP|435954 from Anabaena and OMNI|NTL02SC1199 from Strep. coelicolor) and one protein (OMNI|NTL01NS2636 from Nostoc) which contains N-terminal homology with a small group of hypothetical proteins but no evidence of a thiolation domain next to the putative reductase domain.
CC  Below the noise cutoff to this model are proteins containing more distantly related ketoreductase and dehydratase/epimerase domains.
CC  It has been suggested [3] that a NADP-binding motif can be found in the N-terminal portion of this domain that may form a Rossman-type fold.

CC  Flavodoxins are small redox-active proteins with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic group. They can act in nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase, in sulfite reduction, and light-dependent NADP+ reduction in during photosynthesis, among other roles. This model describes the short chain type. Many of these are involved in sulfite reduction.

It was just shown, in E. coli and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (and previously for some eukaryotic homologs) to act as fourth type of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase. In E. coli, this protein was earlier reported to be produced during stationary phase, bind to the trp repressor, and make trp operon repression more efficient. WrbA does not interact with the trp operator by itself. Members are found in species in which homologs of the E. coli trp operon repressor TrpR (SP:P03032) are not detected.

CC  This model represents a family of protist lactate dehydrogenases which have aparrently evolved  from a recent protist malate dehydrogenase ancestor [1].  Lactate dehydrogenase converts the hydroxyl at C-2 of lactate to a carbonyl in the product, pyruvate.  The preference of this enzyme for NAD or NADP has not been determined.  A critical residue in malate dehydrogenase, arginine-91 (T. vaginalis numbering) has been mutated to a leucine, eliminating the positive charge which complemeted the carboxylate in malate which is absent in lactate.  Several other more subtle changes are proposed to make the active site smaller to accomadate the less bulky lactate molecule.

CC  This enzyme converts malate into oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle.  The critical residues which discriminate malate dehydrogenase from lactate dehydrogenase have been characterized [1], and have been used to set the cutoffs for this model.  Sequences showing [aflimv][ap]R[rk]pgM[st] and [ltv][ilm]gGhgd were kept above trusted, while those in which the capitalized residues in the patterns were found to be Q, E and E were kept below the noise cutoff.  Some sequences in the grey zone have been annotated as malate dehydrogenases, but none have been characterized.
CC  Phylogenetically, a clade of sequences from eukaryotes such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium which include a characterized lactate dehydrogenase and show abiguous critical residue patterns appears to be more closely related to these bacterial sequences than other eukaryotic sequences.  These are relatively long branch and have been excluded from the model.  All other sequences falling below trusted appear to be phylogenetically outside of the clade including the trusted hits.
CC  The annotation of Botryococcus braunii as lactate dehydrogenase appears top be in error.  This was initially annotated as MDH by Swiss-Prot and then changed.  The rationale for either of these annotations is not traceable.

CC  GABA permease (gabP) catalyzes the translocation of 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) across the plasma membrane, with homologues expressed in Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. This permease is a highly hydrophobic transmembrane protein consisting of 12 transmembrane domains with hydrophilic N- and C-terminal ends [1]. Induced by nitrogen-limited culture conditions in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, gabP is an energy dependent transport system stimulated by membrane potential and has been observed adjacent and distant from other GABA degradation proteins [1,2].
CC  GabP is highly homologous to amino acid permeases from B. subtilis, E. coli, as well as to other members of the amino acid permease family (PF00324). A member of the APC (amine-polyamine-choline) transporter superfamily, GABA permease possesses a "consensus amphiphatic region" (CAR) found to be evolutionarily conserved within this transport family [3]. This amphiphatic region is located between helix 8 and cytoplasmic loop 8-9, forming a potential channel domain and suggested to play a significant role in ligand recognition and translocation [3]. Unique to GABA permeases, a conserved cysteine residue (CYS-300, E.coli) located at the beginning of the amphiphatic domain, has been determined to be critical for catalytic specificity [3].

EC  1.2.1.-
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is one of three enzymes constituting 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) degradation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, catalyzing the (NAD(P)+)-dependent catabolism reaction of succinic semialdehyde to succinate for metabolism by the citric acid cycle. The EC number depends on the cofactor: 1.2.1.24 for NAD only, 1.2.1.79 for NADP only, and 1.2.1.16 if both can be used.
CC  In Escherichia coli, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is located in an unidirectionally transcribed gene cluster encoding enzymes for GABA degradation and is suggested to be cotranscribed with succinic semialdehyde transaminase from a common promoter upstream of SSADH [1]. Similar gene arrangements can be found in characterized Ralstonia eutropha [2] and the genome analysis of Bacillus subtilis.
CC  Prokaryotic succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases (1.2.1.16) share high sequence homology to characterized succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases from rat and human (1.2.1.24), exhibiting conservation of proposed cofactor binding residues, and putative active sites (G-237 & G-242, C-293 & G-259 respectively of rat SSADH) [3].
CC  Eukaryotic SSADH enzymes exclusively utilize NAD+ as a cofactor, exhibiting little to no NADP+ activity [4]. While a NADP+ preference has been detected in prokaryotes in addition to both NADP+- and NAD+-dependencies as in E.coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella pneumoniae [2]. The function of this alternative SSADH currently is unknown, but has been suggested to play a possible role in 4-hydroxyphenylacetic degradation [2].
CC  Just outside the scope of this model, are several sequences belonging to clades scoring between trusted and noise. These sequences may be actual SSADH enzymes, but lack sufficiently close characterized homologs to make a definitive assignment at this time.
CC  SSADH enzyme belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family (PF00171), sharing a common evolutionary origin and enzymatic mechanism with lactaldehyde dehydrogenase [5]. Like in lactaldehyde dehydrogenase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, the mammalian catalytic glutamic acid and cysteine residues are conserved in all the enzymes of this family (PS00687, PS00070).

In fact, the Crescentus and Xanthomonas sequences are inseparable on a phylogenetic tree using a PAM-weighted neighbor-joining method, indicating that one of the two genuses may have acquired this set of receptors from the other.

Isochorismate-pyruvate lyase presumably catalyzes the same type of 2+2+2 cyclo-rearrangement as chorismate mutase, but acting on isochorismate, this results in two broken bonds instead of one broken and one made.

This choline-glycine betaine synthesis pathway can be found in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
CC  In Escherichia coli, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (betB) is osmotically co-induced with choline dehydrogenase (betA) in the presence of choline. These dehydrogenases are located in a betaine gene cluster with the upstream choline transporter (betT) and transcriptional regulator (betI) [1]. 
CC  Similar to E.coli, betaine synthesis in Staphylococcus xylosus is also influenced by osmotic stress and the presence of choline with genes localized in a functionally equivalent gene cluster [2].
CC  Organization of the betaine gene cluster in Sinorhizobium meliloti and Bacillus subtilis differs from that of E.coli by the absence of upstream choline transporter and transcriptional regulator homologues [2,3]. Additionally, B.subtilis co-expresses a type II alcohol dehydrogenase with betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase instead of choline dehydrogenase as in E.coli, St.xylosus, and Si.meliloti [3].
CC  Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family (PF00171).

Although the most likely function for the enzymes represented by this model is as a chorismate mutase, in no species are these enzymes the sole chorismate mutase in the genome.  Also, in no case are these enzymes located in a region of the genome proximal to any other enzymes involved in chorismate pathways.  Although the Pantoea enzyme has been shown to complement a CM-free mutant of E. coli [1], this was also shown to be the case with isochorismate-pyruvate lyase which only has a secondary (non-physiologically relevant) chorismate mutase activity [2].  This enzyme is believed to be a homodimer and be localized to the periplasm.

CC  Choline dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of exogenously supplied choline into the intermediate glycine betaine aldehyde, as part of a two-step oxidative reaction leading to the formation of osmoprotectant betaine. This enzymatic system can be found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
CC  As in Escherichia coli [1], Staphylococcus xylosus [2], and Sinorhizobium meliloti [3], this enzyme is found associated in a transciptionally co-induced gene cluster with betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, the second catalytic enzyme in this reaction. Other gram-positive organisms have been shown to employ a different enzymatic system, utlizing a soluable choline oxidase or type III alcohol dehydrogenase instead of choline dehydrogenase [4].
CC  This enzyme is a member of the GMC oxidoreductase family (PF00732 and PF05199), sharing a common evoluntionary origin and enzymatic reaction with alcohol dehydrogenase [5]. Outgrouping from this model, Caulobacter crescentus shares sequence homology with choline dehydrogenase, yet other genes participating in this enzymatic reaction have not currently been identified.

This clade includes one characterized enzyme from Lactococcus [1] and the conserved function across the clade is supported by these pieces of evidence: 1) all genomes with a member in this clade also have a separate TrpE gene, 2) none of these genomes contain an aparrent PabB from any of the other PabB clades, 3) none of these sequences are found in a region of the genome in association with other Trp biosynthesis genes, 4) all of these genomes aparrently contain most if not all of the steps of the folate biosynthetic pathway (for which PABA is a precursor).
CC  Many of the sequences hit by this model are annotated as TrpE enzymes, however, we believe that all members of this clade are, in fact, PabB.

This family is downgraded to subfamily for this NodG. Other proteins designated NodG, as from Rhizobium, belong to related but distinct protein families.

This pathway is found primarily in eukaryotes and archaea, but the bacterial homologs are distinct, having aparrently diverged after being laterally transferred from an early eukaryote [1].  HMG-CoA synthase is the first step in the pathway and joins acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA with the release of one molecule of CoA.  The Borellia sequence may have resulted from a separate lateral transfer event.

OMF proteins operate in conjunction with a primary transporter of the RND, MFS, ABC, or PET systems, and a MFP (membrane fusion protein) to tranport substrates across membranes. The complex thus formed allows transport (export) of various solutes (heavy metal cations; drugs, oligosaccharides, proteins, etc.) across the two envelopes of the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope in a single energy-coupled step. Current data suggest that the OMF (and not the MFP) is largely responsible for the formation of both the trans-outer membrane and trans-periplasmic channels. The roles played by the MFP have yet to be determined.

We designate this family Csd1 (CRISPR/Cas Subtype DVULG protein 1). The species range for this subtype, so far, is exclusively bacterial and mesophilic, although CRISPR loci in general are particularly common among archaea and thermophilic bacteria. In a few species (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 and Streptococcus mutans UA159), homology to this protein family is split across two tandem genes; the trusted cutoff to this family is set low enough to capture at least the longer of the two.

CC  This HMM describes the final step in the biosynthesis of ornithine from glutamate via the non-acetylated pathway.  Ornithine amino transferase takes L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde and makes it into ornithine, which is used in the urea cycle, as well as in the biosynthesis of arginine.  This model includes low-GC bacteria and eukaryotic species.  The genes from two species are annotated as putative acetylornithine aminotransferases - one from Porphyromonas gingivalis (OMNI|PG1271), and the other from Staphylococcus aureus (OMNI|SA0170).  After homology searching using BLAST it was determined that these two sequences were most closely related to ornithine aminotransferases. This model's seed includes one characterized hit, from Bacillus subtilis (SP|P38021).

CC  This model represents a small clade of dipeptidase enzymes which are members of the larger M25 subfamily of metalloproteases.  Two characterized enzymes are included in the seed.  One, from Lactococcus lactis has been shown to act on a wide range of dipeptides, but not larger peptides.  The enzyme from Lactobacillus delbrueckii was originally characterized as a Xaa-His dipeptidase, specifically a carnosinase (beta-Ala-His) by complementation of an E. coli mutant.  Further study, including the crystallization of the enzyme [1], has shown it to also be a non-specific dipeptidase.  This group also includes enzymes from Streptococcus and Enterococcus.

CC  CRISPR is a term for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palidromic Repeats. A number of protein families appear only in association with these repeats and are designated Cas (CRISPR-Associated) proteins. This (revised) HMM describes a conserved region from an otherwise highly divergent protein found in the Tneap subtype of CRISPR/Cas regions. This Cys-rich region features two motifs of CXXC.

When catalyzing the degradative reaction on fatty acids the corresponding EC number is 2.3.1.16.  The condensation reaction corresponds to 2.3.1.9.  Note that the enzymes which catalyze the condensation are generally not involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, which is carried out by a decarboxylating condensation of acetyl and malonyl esters of acyl carrier proteins.  Rather, this activity may produce acetoacetyl-CoA for pathways such as IPP biosynthesis in the absence of sufficient fatty acid oxidation.

CC  HflK and HflC are paralogs encoded by tandem genes in Proteobacteria, spirochetes, and some other bacterial lineages.  The HflKC complex is anchored in the membrane and exposed to the periplasm. The complex is not active as a protease, but rather binds to and appears to modulate the ATP-dependent protease FtsH. The overall function of HflKC is not fully described.//Regulation of FtsH by HflKC appears to be negative (PMID:8947034,PMID:96367) [SS 8/27/03]

CC  This model represents a family of methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and ubiqinone.  Some members such as the UbiE enzyme from E. coli [1] are believed to act in both pathways, while others may act in only the menaquinone pathway.  These methyltransferases are members of the UbiE/CoQ family of methyltransferases (PF01209) which also contains ubiquinone methyltransferases and other methyltransferases.
CC  Members of this clade include a wide distribution of bacteria and eukaryotes, but no archaea.  An outgroup for this clade is provided by the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.17) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides [2].
CC  Note that a number of non-orthologous genes which are members of PF03737 have been erroneously annotated as MenG methyltransferases.

CC  The E. coli member of this family has been characterized as a regulator of RNase E [1] and its crystal structure has been analyzed [2].
CC  This model was initially classified as a "hypothetical equivalog" expressing the tentative hypothesis that all members might have the same function as the E. coli enzyme.  Considering the second clade of enterobacterial sequences within this family, that appears to be less tenable.  The function of these sequences outside of the narrow RraA equivalog model (TIGR02998) remains obscure.  All of these were initially annotated as MenG, AKA S-adenosylmethionine: 2-demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase (EC 2.1.-.-).  See the references characterizing this as a case of transitive annotation error [2,3] in the case of the E. coli protein.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a clade of sequences related to fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (class I, included within PF01791). The members of this clade appear to be phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolases.  This enzyme is the first step of the chorismate biosynthesis pathway.  Evidence for this assignment is based on gene clustering and phylogenetic profiling.
CC  A group of species lack members of the three other types of  phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase (represented by TIGR00034, TIGR01358 and TIGR01361), and also aparrently lack the well-known forms of step 2 (3-dehydroquinate synthase), but contain all other steps of the pathway: Desulfovibrio, Aquifex, Archaeoglobus, Halobacterium,  Methanopyrus, Methanococcus and Methanobacterium.  The clade of sequences represented here is limited strictly to this group of organisms.
CC  In Desulfovibrio, Aquifex, Archaeoglobus, Halobacterium and Methanosarcina the genes found by this model are clustered with other genes from the chorismate, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways.  
CC  In addition, these genes in Desulfovibrio, Archaeoglobus, Halobacterium, Methanosarcina and Methanopyrus are adjacent to a gene which hits PF01959 which also has the property of having members only in those species which lack steps 1 and 2.  
CC  Together these two genes appear to perform the synthesis of 3-dehydroquinate.  It is presumed that the substrates and the chemical transformations involved are identical, but this has not yet been proven experimentally.

CC  SoxR is a MerR-family homodimeric transcription factor with a 2Fe-2S cluster in each monomer. The motif CIGCGCxxxxxC is conserved. Oxidation of the iron-sulfur cluster activates SoxR. The physiological role in E. coli is response to oxidative stress. It is activated by superoxide, singlet oxygen, nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen peroxide. In E. coli, SoxR increases expression of transcription factor SoxS; different downstream targets may exist in other species.

It binds to RNA polymerase alpha subunit and promotes termination at certain RNA hairpin structures. It is named for the interaction in E. coli of phage lambda antitermination protein N with the N-utilization substance, consisting of NusA, NusB, NusE (ribosomal protein S10), and nusG. This model represents a region of NusA shared in all bacterial forms, and including an S1 (PF00575) and a KH (PF00013) RNA binding domains. Proteobacterial forms have an additional C-terminal region, not included in this model, with two repeats of 50-residue domain rich in acidic amino acids.

CC  NusA is a bacterial transcription termination factor. It is named for its interaction with phage lambda protein N, as part of the N utilization substance. Some members of the NusA family have a long C-terminal extension. This HMM represents an acidic 50-residue region found in two copies toward the C-terminus of most Proteobacterial NusA proteins, spaced about 26 residues apart. Analogous C-terminal extensions in some other bacterial lineages lack apparent homology but appear similarly acidic.

CC  This model represents an O-methyltransferase believed to act at two points in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway in bacteria (UbiG) and fungi (COQ3) [1,2].  A separate methylase (MenG/UbiE) catalyzes the single C-methylation step.  The most commonly used names for genes in this family do not indicate whether this gene is an O-methyl, or C-methyl transferase.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM represents a family of FAD-dependent hydroxylases (monooxygenases) which are all believed to act in the aerobic ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway [1].  A separate set of hydroxylases, as yet undiscovered, are believed to be active under anaerobic conditions [2].  In E. coli three enzyme activities have been described, UbiB (which acts first at position 6, see TIGR01982), UbiH (which acts at position 4, [3]) and UbiF (which acts at position 5, [4]).  UbiH and UbiF are similar to one another and form the basis of this subfamily.  Interestingly, E. coli contains another hydroxylase gene, called visC, that is highly similar to UbiF, adjacent to UbiH and, when mutated, results in a phenotype similar to that of UbiH (which has also been named visB) [5].  Several other species appear to have three homologs in this family, although they assort themselves differently on phylogenetic trees (e.g. Xylella and Mesorhizobium) making it difficult to ascribe a specific activity to each one.  Eukaryotes appear to have only a single homolog in this subfamily (COQ6, [6]) which complements UbiH, but also possess a non-orthologous gene, COQ7 which complements UbiF.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents the beta-phosphoglucomutase enzyme which catalyzes the interconverison of beta-D-glucose-1-phosphate and beta-D-glucose-6-phosphate.  The 6-phosphate is capable of non-enzymatic anomerization (alpha <-> beta) while the 1-phosphate is not.  A separate enzyme is responsible for the isomerization of the alpha anomers.  Beta-D-glucose-1-phosphate results from the phosphorylysis of maltose (2.4.1.8), trehalose (2.4.1.64) or trehalose-6-phosphate (2.4.1.216).  Alternatively, these reactions can be run in the synthetic direction to create the disaccharides.  All sequenced genomes which contain a member of this family also appear to contain at least one putative maltose or trehalose phosphorylase.  Three species, Lactococcus, Enterococcus and Neisseria appear to contain a pair of paralogous beta-PGM's.
CC  Beta-phosphoglucomutase is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of hydrolase enzymes.  These enzymes are characterized by a series of three catalytic motifs positioned within an alpha-beta (Rossman) fold [1].  beta-PGM contains an inserted alpha helical domain in between the first and second conserved motifs and thus is a member of subfamily IA of the superfamily [2,3].  The third catalytic motif comes in three variants, the third of which, containing a conserved DD or ED, is the only one found here as well as in several other related enzymes (TIGR01509).
CC  The enzyme from L. lactis has been extensively characterized including a remarkable crystal structure which traps the pentacoordinate transition state [4].

CC  This HMM represents the fused enzyme II B and C components of the trehalose-specific PTS sugar transporter system [1].  Trehalose is converted to trehalose-6-phosphate in the process of translocation into the cell.  These transporters lack their own IIA domains and instead use the glucose IIA protein (IIAglc or Crr) [2].  The exceptions to this rule are Staphylococci and Streptococci which contain their own A domain as a C-terminal fusion.
CC  This family is closely related to the sucrose transporting PTS IIBC enzymes and the B and C domains of each are described by subfamily-domain level TIGRFAMs models (TIGR00826 and TIGR00852, respectively).
CC  In E. coli, B. subtilis and P. fluorescens the presence of this gene is associated with the presence of trehalase which degrades T6P to glucose and glucose-6-P.

In chlorophyll-utilizing species, this gene is known as ChlH, while in bacteriochlorophyll-utilizing spoecies it is called BchH.  Subunit H is the largest (~140kDa) of the three subunits (the others being BchD/ChlD and BchI/ChlI), and is known to bind protoporphyrin IX.  Subunit H is homologous to the CobN subunit of cobaltochelatase and by anology with that enzyme, subunit H is believed to also bind the magnesium ion which is inserted into the ring.  In conjunction with the hydrolysis of ATP by subunits I and D, a conformation change is believed to happen in subunit H causing the magnesium ion insertion into the distorted protoporphyrin ring [1].

CC  This HMM represents the cobalamin-dependent oxidative cyclase, a radical SAM enzyme responsible for forming the distinctive E-ring of the chlorin ring system under anaerobic conditions [1].  This step is essential in the biosynthesis of both bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll under anaerobic conditions (a separate enzyme, AcsF, acts under aerobic conditions).  This model identifies two clades of sequences, one from photosynthetic, non-cyanobacterial bacteria and another including Synechocystis and several non-photosynthetic bacteria.  The function of the Synechocystis gene is supported by gene clustering with other photosynthetic genes, so the purpose of the gene in the non-photosynthetic bacteria is uncertain.  Note that homologs of this gene are not found in plants which rely solely on the aerobic cyclase.

The RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. The amino terminal domain is involved in dimerizing and assembling the other RNA polymerase subunits into a transcriptionally active enzyme. The carboxy-terminal domain contains determinants for interaction with DNA and with transcriptional activator proteins.

CC  Metabolic assimilation of sulfur from inorganic sulfate, requires sulfate activation by coupling to a nucleoside, for the production of high-energy nucleoside phosphosulfates. This pathway appears to be similar in all prokaryotic organisms. Activation is first achieved through sulfation of sulfate with ATP by sulfate adenylyltransferase (ATP sulfurylase) to produce 5'-phosphosulfate (APS), coupled by GTP hydrolysis. Subsequently, APS is phosphorylated by an APS kinase to produce 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) [1].
CC  In Escherichia coli, ATP sulfurylase is a heterodimer composed of two subunits encoded by cysD and cysN, with APS kinase encoded by cysC. These genes are located in a unidirectionally transcribed gene cluster, and have been shown to be required for the synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids [1].
CC  Homologous to this E.coli activation pathway are nodPQH gene products found among members of the Rhizobiaceae family. These gene products have been shown to exhibit ATP sulfurase and APS kinase activity, yet are involved in Nod factor sulfation, and sulfation of other macromolecules [2]. With members of the Rhizobiaceae family, nodQ often appears as a fusion of cysN (large subunit of ATP sulfurase) and cysC (APS kinase) [2,3].

CC  This HMM represents the copper-, silver- and gold- (I) responsive transcriptional activator of the gamma proteobacterial copper efflux system [1].  This protein is a member of the MerR family of transcriptional activators (PF00376) and contains a distinctive pattern of cysteine residues in its metal binding loop, Cys-X7-Cys.  This family also lacks a conserved cysteine at the N-terminal end of the dimerization helix which is required for the binding of divalent metals such as zinc; here it is replaced by a serine residue [2].

CC  Dissimilatory sulfite reductase catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide, as the terminal reaction in dissimilatory sulfate reduction. It remains unclear however, whether trithionate and thiosulfate serve as intermediate compounds to sulfide, or as end products of sulfite reduction [1].
CC  Sulfite reductase is a multisubunit enzyme composed of dimers of either alpha/beta or alpha/beta/gamma subunits, each containing a siroheme and iron sulfur cluster prosthetic center [2]. Found in sulfate-reducing bacteria, these genes are commonly located in an unidirectional gene cluster [3].

CC  Cyanophycin is an insoluble storage polymer for carbon, nitrogen, and energy, found in most Cyanobacteria. The polymer has a backbone of L-aspartic acid, with most Asp side chain carboxyl groups attached to L-arginine. The polymer is made by this enzyme, cyanophycin synthetase, and degraded by cyanophycinase. Heterologously expressed cyanophycin synthetase in E. coli produces a closely related, water-soluble polymer with some Arg replaced by Lys. It is unclear whether enzymes that produce soluble cyanophycin-like polymers in vivo in non-Cyanobacterial species should be designated as cyanophycin synthetase itself or as a related enzyme. This model makes the designation as cyanophycin synthetase.
CC  Cyanophycin synthesis is analogous to polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) biosynthesis, except that PHA polymers lack nitrogen and may be made under nitrogen-limiting conditions.

It should be looked for in genomes of the proteobacteria, immediately upstream of genes for threonine biosynthesis, typically aspartokinase I/homoserine dehydrogenase, homoserine kinase, and threonine synthase. Transcription of the rest of the Thr operon is attenuated (mostly turned off) unless the ribosome pauses during a stretch of the leader sequence rich in both Ile (made from Thr) and in Thr itself because of the scarcity of  those amino acids at the time. The leader peptide itself, once made, may have no role other than to be degraded. Similar systems exist for some other amino acid biosynthetic operons, such as Trp.

CC  Methanogenic archaea contain three closely related homologs of the 2-isopropylmalate synthases (LeuA) represented by TIGR00973.  Two of these in Methanococcus janaschii (MJ1392 - CimA [1]; MJ0503 - AksA [2]) have been characterized as catalyzing alternative reactions leaving the third (MJ1195) as the presumptive LeuA enzyme.  
CC  CimA is citramalate (2-methylmalate) synthase which condenses acetyl-CoA with pyruvate.  This enzyme is believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of isoleucine in methanogens and possibly other species lacking threonine dehydratase.
CC  AksA is a homocitrate synthase which also produces (homo)2-citrate and (homo)3-citrate in the biosynthesis of Coenzyme B which is restricted solely to methanogenic archaea.
CC  Methanogens, then should and aparrently do contain all three of these enzymes.  Unfortunately, phylogenetic trees do not resolve into three unambiguous clades, making assignment of function to particular genes problematic.  Other archaea which lack a threonine dehydratase (mainly Euryarchaeota) should contain both a CimA and a LeuA gene.  This is true of, for example, archaeoglobus fulgidis, but not for the Pyrococci which have none in this clade, but one in TIGR00973 and one in TIGRT00977 which may fulfill these roles.  Other species which have only one hit to this model and lack threonine dehydratase are very likely LeuA enzymes.

Both subunits are homologous and included in this model. In bacteria, both homomeric forms of GlgC and more active heterodimers of GlgC and GlgD have been described. This model describes the GlgC subunit only. This enzyme appears in variants of glycogen synthesis pathways that use ADP-glucose, rather than UDP-glucose as in animals.

The nomenclature convention is to preface the name according to the natural substrate, as in glycogen phosphorylase, starch phosphorylase, maltodextrin phosphorylase, etc. Name differences among these substrates reflect differences in patterns of branching with alpha 1,6 linkages. Members include allosterically regulated and unregulated forms. A related family, TIGR02094, contains examples known to act well on particularly small alpha 1,4 glucans, as may be found after import from exogenous sources.

The name of the glucose storage polymer substrate, and therefore the name of this enzyme, depends on the chain lengths and branching patterns. A number of the members of this family have been shown to operate on small maltodextrins, as may be obtained by utilization of exogenous sources.

CC  Pantothenate (vitamin B5) is a precursor of coenzyme A and is made from aspartate and 2-oxoisovalerate in most bacteria with completed genome sequences. However, some pathogens must import pantothenate. This HMM describes PanF, a sodium/pantothenate symporter, from a larger family of  Sodium/substrate symporters (PF00474). Several species that have this transporter appear to lack all enzymes of pantothenate biosynthesis, namely Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Borrelia burgdorferi.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This membrane protein is a component of the terminal branch complex of the general secretion pathway (GSP), also known as the"Type II" secretion pathway.  The GSP transports proteins (generally virulence-associated cell wall hydrolases) across the outer membrase of the bacterial cell. Transport across the inner membrane is often, but not exclusively handled by the Sec system.  This model was constructed from the broader subfamily model, PF00482 which includes components of pilin complexes (PilC) as well as other related genes.  GspF is nearly always gene clustered with other GSP subunits.  Some genes from Xylella and Xanthomonas strains score below the trusted cutoff due to excessive divergence from the family such that a sequence from Deinococcus which does not appear to be GspF scores higher.

Some archaea have a separate homocitrate synthase (AksA) which also synthesizes longer homocitrate analogs [2].

Often located in a conserved gene cluster with enzymes involved in phenylacetic acid activation (paaG/H/I/J), phenylacetate-CoA ligase has been found among the proteobacteria as well as in gram positive prokaryotes [2]. In the B-subclass proteobacterium Azoarcus evansii, phenylacetate-CoA ligase has been shown to be induced under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. It remains unclear however, whether this induction is due to the same enzyme or to another isoenzyme restricted to specific anaerobic growth conditions [3].

CC  NrdH-redoxin is a representative of a class of small redox proteins that contain a conserved CXXC motif and are characterized by a glutaredoxin-like amino acid sequence and thioredoxin-like activity profile.  Unlike other the glutaredoxins to which it is most closely related, NrdH aparrently does not interact with glutathione/glutathione reductase, but rather with thioredoxin reductase to catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase.

CC  The phage integrase family describes a number of recombinases with tyrosine active sites that transiently bind covalently to DNA. Many are associated with mobile DNA elements, including phage, transposons, and phase variation loci. This model represents XerC, one of two closely related chromosomal proteins along with XerD (TIGR02225). XerC and XerD are site-specific recombinases which help resolve chromosome dimers to monomers for cell division after DNA replication. In species with a large chromosome and homologs of XerC on other replicons, the chomosomal copy was preferred for building this model. This model does not detect all XerC, as some apparent XerC examples score in the gray zone between trusted (450) and noise (410) cutoffs, along with some XerD examples. XerC and XerD interact with cell division protein FtsK.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model includes a 5'-nucleotidase specific for purines (IMP and GMP) [1].  These enzymes are members of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily.  HAD members are recognized by three short motifs {hhhhDxDx(T/V)}, {hhhh(T/S)}, and either {hhhh(D/E)(D/E)x(3-4)(G/N)} or {hhhh(G/N)(D/E)x(3-4)(D/E)} (where "h" stands for a hydrophobic residue).  Crystal structures of many HAD enzymes has verified PSI-PRED predictions of secondary structural elements which show each of the "hhhh" sequences of the motifs as part of beta sheets.  This subfamily of enzymes is part of "Subfamily I" of the HAD superfamily by virtue of a "cap" domain in between motifs 1 and 2.  This subfamily's cap domain has a different predicted secondary structure than all other known HAD enzymes and thus has been designated "subfamily IG".  This domain appears to consist of a mixed alpha/beta fold.
CC  A Pfam model (PF05761) detects an identical range of sequences above the trusted cutoff, but does not model the N-terminal motif 1 region.
CC  A TIGRFAMs model (TIGR01993) represents a (putative) family of _pyrimidine_ 5'-nucleotidases which are also subfamily I HAD's, which should not be confused with the current model.

CC  This domain is related to domains found in FCP1-like phosphatases (TIGR02250), and together both are detected by the Pfam model PF03031.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family of proteins includes uncharacterized sequences from eukaryotes, cyanobacteria and Leptospira as well as the DREG-2 protein from Drosophila melanogaster which has been identified as a rhythmically (diurnally) regulated gene [1].
CC  This family is a member of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs [2].  The subfamilies are defined [3] based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called 'capping domain' [4], or the absence of such a domain.  This family is a member of subfamily 1A in which the cap domain consists of a predicted alpha helical bundle  found in between the first and second catalytic motifs.  A distinctive feature of this family is a conserved tandem pair of tryptophan residues in the cap domain.  The most divergent sequences included within the scope of this model are from plants and have "FW" at this position instead.
CC  Most likely, these sequences, like the vast majority of HAD sequences, represent phosphatase enzymes.

Some genomes contain these other genes without an apparent paaC in the same operon - possibly in these cases a different dehydrogenase involved in fatty acid degradation may fill in the needed activity.  This enzyme has domains which are members of the PF02737 and PF00725 families.

This activity is consistent with current hypotheses for the degradation pathway [2] which involve the ligation of phenylacetate with coenzyme A (paaF), hydroxylation (paaGHIJK), ring-opening (paaN) and degradation of the resulting fatty acid-like compound to a Krebs cycle intermediate (paaABCDE).

CC  The member of this family from Deinococcus radiodurans, a species that withstands and recovers from extensive radiation or dessication damage, is an apparent RNA ligase. It repairs RNA stand breaks in nicked DNA:RNA and RNA:RNA but not DNA:DNA duplexes. It has adenylyltransferase activity associated with the C-terminal domain.  Related proteins also in this family are found in Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 and in bacteriophage 44RR2.8t. The phage example is unsurprising since one mechanism of host cell defense against phage is cleavage and inactivation of certain tRNA molecules. A fungal sequence from Neurospora crassa scores between trusted and noise cutofffs and may be similar in function.

The product of DapA, dihydrodipicolinate, results from the non-enzymatic cyclization and dehydration of 6-amino-2,4-dihydroxyhept-2-ene-1,7-dioic acid, which is different from the substrate of this reaction only in the presence of the amino group.  In the absence of this amino group, and running the reaction in the opposite direction, the reaction corresponds to the HpaI aldolase component of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid catabolism pathway (see TIGR02311).  At present, this variant of DapA is found only in Oceanobacillus iheyensis HTE831 and Thermus thermophilus HB27.  In both of these cases, one or more other DapA genes can be found and the one identified by this model is part of an operon for 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid catabolism.

This gene generally occurs in prokaryotic organisms adjacent to the gene for phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase (aepY).  Since the PEP phosphomutase reaction favors the substrate PEP energetically, the decarboxylase is required to drive the reaction in the direction of phosphonate production.  Most often an aminotansferase (aepZ) is also present which leads to the production of the most common phosphonate compound, 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP).

CC  Sequences in this family are tandem repeats of about 79 amino acids, present in up to 14 copies in a protein and highly identical, even at the DNA level, within each protein. Sequences with these repeats are found in the Rib and alpha surface antigens of group B Streptococcus, Esp of Enterococcus faecalis, and related proteins of Lactobacillus. The repeat lacks Cys residues. Most members of this protein family also have the cell wall anchor motif LPXTG shared by many staphyloccal and streptococcal surface antigens.

Member of this family are found in a number of proteobacterial genomes, but only in the context of   having genes for 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HPA) degradation. The protein is characterized by Prieto, et al.

CC  The 2-methylcitrate cycle is one of at least five degradation pathways for propionate via propionyl-CoA. Degradation of propionate toward pyruvate consumes oxaloacetate and releases succinate. Oxidation of succinate back into oxaloacetate by the TCA cycle makes the 2-methylcitrate pathway a cycle. This family consists of PrpF, an incompletely characterized protein that appears to be an essential accessory protein for the Fe/S-dependent 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase AcnD (TIGR02333). This protein is related to but distinct from FldA (part of Pfam family PF04303), a putative fluorene degradation protein of Sphingomonas sp. LB126.

Phosphonates are organic compounds with a direct C-P bond that is far less labile that the C-O-P bonds of phosphate attachment sites. Phosphonates may be degraded for phosphorus and energy by broad spectrum C-P lyase encoded by large operon or by specific enzymes for some of the more common phosphonates in nature. This family represents an enzyme from the latter category. It may be found encoded near genes for phosphonate transport and for pther specific phosphonatases.

Species with this protein always lack the ThiBPQ ABC transporter. In some species (e.g. Steptococcus mutans and Streptoccus pyogenes), yuaJ is the only THI-regulated gene. Evidence from Bacillus cereus indicated thiamine uptake is coupled to proton translocation. However, a more recent comprehensive study of energy-coupled factor (ECF) transport suggests this protein is the S (subtrate capture) component of an ECF system, meaning it is energized by ATP. Previously YuaJ, but renamed ThiT.

This element is called a riboswitch and is seen also for other metabolites such as FMN and glycine. This protein family consists of proteins identified in operons controlled by the THI riboswitch and designated ThiW. The hydrophobic nature of this protein and reconstructed metabolic background suggests that this protein acts in transport of a thiazole precursor of thiamine.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Plasmids may be maintained stably in bacterial populations through the action of addiction modules, in which a toxin and antidote are encoded in a cassette on the plasmid. In any daughter cell that lacks the plasmid, the toxin persists and is lethal after the antidote protein is depleted. Toxin/antitoxin pairs are also found on main chromosomes, and likely represent selfish DNA. Sequences in the seed for this alignment all are found adjacent to RelB/DinJ family antitoxin genes (TIGR02384), as are most genes found by the resulting model. StbE from Morganella morganii plasmid R485 shows typical behaviour for an addiction module toxin. It cannot be cloned without its partner (the antitoxin), whereas its partner cannot confer plasmid stability without StbE.

The gene symbol OtsA stands for osmotically regulated trehalose synthesis A. Trehalose helps protect against both osmotic and thermal stresses, and is made from two glucose subunits. This model excludes glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase, an enzyme of an analogous osmoprotectant system in many cyanobacterial strains.  This model does not identify archaeal examples, as they are more divergent than glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase. Sequences that score in the gray zone between the trusted and noise cutoffs include a number of yeast multidomain proteins in which the N-terminal domain may be functionally equivalent to this family. The gray zone also includes the OtsA of Cornyebacterium glutamicum (and related species), shown to be responsible for synthesis of only trace amounts of trehalose while the majority is synthesized by the TreYZ pathway; the significance of OtsA in this species is unclear (see Wolf, et al., PMID:12890033).

CC  This family is a subset of the members of the zinc metallopeptidase family M1 (PF01433), with a single member characterized in Streptomyces lividans 66 and designated aminopeptidase N. The spectrum of activity may differ somewhat from the aminopeptidase N clade of E. coli and most other Proteobacteria, well separated phylogenetically within the M1 family. The M1 family also includes leukotriene A-4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase (with a bifunctional active site).

CC  The M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases contains a number of distinct, well-separated clades of proteins with aminopeptidase activity. Several are designated aminopeptidase N, EC 3.4.11.2, after the Escherichia coli enzyme, suggesting a similar activity profile (see SP|P04825 for a description of catalytic activity). This family consists of all aminopeptidases closely related to E. coli PepN and presumed to have similar (not identical) function. Nearly all are found in Proteobacteria, but members are found also in Cyanobacteria, plants, and apicomplexan parasites. This family differs greatly in sequence from the family of aminopeptidases typified by Streptomyces lividans PepN (TIGR02412), from the membrane bound aminopeptidase N family in animals, etc.

CC  One member of this family, as characterized in Klebsiella terrigena, is described as able to interconvert acetoin + NADH with meso-2,3-butanediol + NAD(+). It is also called capable of irreversible reduction of diacetyl with NADH to acetoin. Blomqvist, et al. decline to specify either EC 1.1.1.4 which is (R,R)-butanediol dehydrogenase, or EC 1.1.1.5, which is acetoin dehydrogenase without a specified stereochemistry, for this enzyme. This enzyme is a homotetramer in the family of short chain dehydrogenases (PF00106). Another member of this family, from Corynebacterium glutamicum, is called L-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (PMID:11577733).

CC  Acetolactate synthase (EC 2.2.1.6) combines two molecules of pyruvate to yield 2-acetolactate with the release of CO2. This reaction may be involved in either valine biosynthesis (biosynthetic) or conversion of pyruvate to acetoin and possibly to 2,3-butanediol (catabolic). The biosynthetic type, described by TIGR00118, is also capable of forming  acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis. The family described here, part of the same larger family of thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes (PF00205, PF02776) is the catabolic form, generally found associated with in species with acetolactate decarboxylase and usually found in the same operon. The model may not encompass all catabolic acetolactate synthases, but rather one particular clade in the larger TPP-dependent enzyme family.

DksA mutants are defective in quorum sensing, virulence, etc. DksA is now understood to bind RNA polymerase directly and modulate its response to small molecules to control the level of transcription of rRNA. Nearly all members of this family are in the Proteobacteria. Whether the closest homologs outside the Proteobacteria function equivalently is unknown. The low value set for the noise cutoff allows identification of possible DksA proteins from outside the proteobacteria. TIGR02419 describes a closely related family of short sequences usually found in prophage regions of proteobacterial genomes or in known phage.

This is followed by three methylation reactions, which introduce a methyl group at C-17 (CobJ; EC 2.1.1.131), C-11 (CobM; EC 2.1.1.133) and C-1 (CobF; EC 2.1.1.152) of the macrocycle, giving rise to precorrin-4, precorrin-5 and precorrin-6A, respectively [1].

However, this location is not conserved, and naming this protein as a 23S RNA protein is both confusing and inaccurate.

CC  Cobaltochelatase is responsible for the insertion of cobalt into the corrin ring of coenzyme B12 during its biosynthesis.  Two versions have been well described. CbiK/CbiX is a monomeric, anaerobic version which acts early in the biosynthesis (PF06180). CobNST is a trimeric, ATP-dependent, aerobic version which acts late in the biosynthesis (TIGR02257/TIGR01650/TIGR01651).
CC  A number of genomes (actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, betaproteobacteria and pseudomonads) which apparently biosynthesize B12, encode a cobN gene but are demonstrably lacking cobS and cobT.  These genomes do, however contain a homolog (modelled here) of the magnesium chelatase subunits BchI/BchD family.  Aside from the cyanobacteria (which have a separate magnesium chelatase trimer), these species do not make chlorins, so do not have any use for a magnesium chelatase.  Furthermore, in nearly all cases the members of this family are proximal to either CobN itself or other genes involved in cobalt transport or B12 biosynthesis.

CC  Trehalose synthase interconverts maltose and alpha, alpha-trehalose by transglucosylation. This is one of at least three mechanisms for biosynthesis of trehalose, an important and widespread compatible solute. However, it is not driven by phosphate activation of sugars and its physiological role may tend toward trehalose degradation. This view is accentuated by numerous examples of fusion to a probable maltokinase domain. The sequence region described by this model is found both as the whole of a trehalose synthase and as the N-terminal region of a larger fusion protein that includes trehalose synthase activity. Several of these fused trehalose synthases have a domain homologous to proteins with maltokinase activity from Actinoplanes missouriensis and Streptomyces coelicolor (PMID:15378530).

CC  Three pathways for the biosynthesis of trehalose, an osmoprotectant that in some species is also a precursor of certain cell wall glycolipids. Trehalose synthase, TreS, can interconvert maltose and trehalose, but while the equilibrium may favor trehalose, physiological concentrations of trehalose may be much greater than that of maltose and TreS may act largely in its degradation. This model describes a domain found only as a C-terminal fusion to TreS proteins. The most closely related proteins outside this family, Pep2 of Streptomyces coelicolor and Mak1 of Actinoplanes missouriensis, have known maltokinase activity. We suggest this domain acts as a maltokinase and helps drive conversion of trehalose to maltose.

Evidence for this assignment includes 1) prediction of a single trans-membrane segment and a C-terminal histidine-rich motif likely to be a metal-binding site, 2) positional gene linkage with known B12 biosynthesis genes, 3) upstream proximity of B12 transcriptional regulatory sites, 4) the absence of other known cobalt import systems and 5) the obligate co-localization with a protein (CbtA) predicted to have five additional trans-membrane segments.

Most hemerythrins are oxygen-carriers with a bound non-heme iron, but at least one example is a cadmium-binding protein, apparently with a role in sequestering toxic metals rather than in binding oxygen. Patterns of conserved residues suggest that all prokaryotic instances of this domain bind iron or another heavy metal, but the exact function is unknown. Not surprisingly, the prokaryote with the most instances of this domain is Magnetococcus sp. MC-1, a magnetotactic bacterium.

CC  This model identifies proteins of two distinct names which may or may not have two distinct functions.
CC  CitB [1] has been identified in salmonella and E. coli as the signal transduction component of a two-component system for citrate in which CitA acts as a citrate transporter.
CC  CobZ is essential for cobalamin biosynthesis (by knockout of the R. capsulatus gene [2]) and is complemented by the characterized precorrin 3B synthase CobG.  The enzyme has been shown to contain flavin, heme and Fe-S cluster cofactors and is believed to require dioxygen as a substrate.  This model identifies the C-terminal domain of the R. capsulatus CobZ, which, in most other species exists as a separate gene adjacent to CobZ.

Most of the sequence-level variability between these forms is concentrated within an N-terminal domain which follows a conserved group of three cysteines and contains a variable pattern of 0 to 8 additional cysteines.

CC  This model represents the alpha (large) chain of the class I ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).  RNR's are responsible for the conversion of the ribose sugar of RNA into the deoxyribose sugar of DNA.  This is the rate-limiting step of DNA biosynthesis.  Class I RNR's generate the required radical (on tyrosine) via a "non-heme" iron cofactor which resides in the beta (small) subunit.  The alpha subunit contains the catalytic and allosteric regulatory sites.  The mechanism of this enzyme requires molecular oxygen [1].
CC  E. Coli contains two versions of this enzyme which are regulated independently (NrdAB and NrdEF, where NrdA and NrdE are the large chains [2,3]).  Most organisms contain only one, but the application of the gene symbols NrdA and NrdE are somewhat arbitrary.
CC  This model identifies RNR's in diverse clades of bacteria, eukaryotes as well as numerous DNA viruses and phage.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  The genes in this family are largely adjacent to genes involved in the biosynthesis of threonine (aspartate kinase, homoserine dehydrogenase and threonine synthase) in genomes which are lacking any other known homoserine kinase, and in which the presence of a homoserine kinase would indicate a complete pathway for the biosynthesis of threonine.  These genes are a member of the (now subfamily, formerly equivalog) TIGR00306 model describing the archaeal form of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase.  All of these are members of a superfamily (PF01676) of metalloenzyme also including phosphopentomutase alkaline phosphatases and sulfatases. 
CC  The proposal that this family encodes a kinase is based on analogy to phosphomutases which are intramolecular phosphotransferases. A mutase active site could evolve to bring together homoserine and a phosphate donor such as phosphoenolpyruvate resulting in a kinase activity.

Such sequences are the recognized for cleavage and methylation, and include pilins and other pilus components and competence and type II secretion secretion proteins. In the present family, the E is not conversed and sequence differs enough that there is no overlap between this family and  TIGR02532.

In some species, direct tRNA-cys aminoacylation also occurs but this pathway is required for Cys biosynthesis. Members of this protein catalyze the second step in this two step pathway, using pyridoxal phosphate and a sulfur donor to synthesize Cys from Sep while attached to the tRNA.

This protein is encoded in a cluster of CRISPR-associated (cas) genes, and in the special case of Myxococcus xanthus has taken on a role in the control of fruiting body development. CRISPRs are clustered, regularly interspaced short palidromic repeats. This protein family is related to models TIGR01868, TIGR01895, and TIGR01876.

Members of this family are widely distributed enough that we designated the family Cas5. Homology appears remote, or absent, between the more C-terminal regions different subfamilies of these proteins, which typically are 210 to 265 amino acids in total length. Cas5 proteins of six different CRISPR/cas subtypes so far defined are described by respective full-length models  TIGR01868, TIGR01876, TIGR01895, TIGR01874, TIGR02586, and TIGR02592. The best characterized protein in this family is DevS or Myxococcus xanthus, a Cas protein that appears to participate in a species-specific developmental pathway.

In nearly every case, this motif is found within nine residues, and usually within five residues, of the extreme C-terminus of the protein. Proteins with this motif typically have signal sequences at the N-terminus. This region appears many times per genome or not at all, and co-occurs in genomes with a proposed protein-sorting integral membrane protein we designate exosortase (see TIGR02602). PEP-CTERM proteins frequently are poorly conserved, Ser/Thr-rich proteins and may become extensively modified proteinaceous constituents of extracellular material in bacterial biofilms.

A pattern of sequence conservation is that every second residue is well-conserved across most of the domain. Pfam model PF05594 is based on a longer, much more poorly conserved multiple sequence alignment and hits some of the same proteins as this model with some overlap between the hit regions of the two models. It describes these repeats as likely to have a beta-helical structure.

CC  This family is designated exosortase, and it is the predicted protein-sorting transpeptidase for the PEP-CTERM protein-sorting signal of many biofilm-producing Gram-negative bacteria. This system is analogous to the sortase/LPXTG system found mostly in Gram-positive bacteria. Members of this family are integral membrane proteins with eight predicted transmembrane helices in common, and with a triad of invariant residues that matches the catalytic triad of sortases. Some members of this family have long trailing sequences past the region described by this model, which in other species is a separate protein EpsI. This model does not include the region of the first predicted transmembrane region. The only partially characterized member is EpsH of Methylobacillus sp. 12S, part of a locus associated with biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide methanolan but itself not involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis.

CC  Members of this protein family, which we designate mobile mystery protein B, are found in mobization-related contexts more often than not, including within a CRISPR-associated gene region in Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA, and on plasmids in  Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Coxiella burnetii, always together with mobile mystery protein A (TIGR02612), a member of the family of helix-turn-helix DNA binding proteins (PF01381). This protein is encoded by the downstream member of the gene pair and belongs to the Fic protein family (PF02661), where Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) is a regulator of cell division. The characteristics of having a two-gene operon in a varied context and often on plasmids, with one member affecting cell division and the other able to bind DNA, suggests similarity to addiction modules.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family consists of FtsW, an integral membrane protein with ten transmembrane segments [1]. In general, it is one of two paralogs involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, the other being RodA, and is essential for cell division. All members of the seed alignment for this model are encoded in operons for the biosynthesis of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, a precursor of murein (peptidoglycan). The FtsW designation is not used in endospore-forming bacterial (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), where the member of this family is designated SpoVE and three or more RodA/FtsW/SpoVE family paralogs are present. SpoVE acts in spore cortex formation and is dispensible for growth. Biological rolls for FtsW in cell division include recruitment of penicillin-binding protein 3 to the division site.

It is suggested (Konan KV and Yanofsky C) that the nascent peptide interacts with the ribosome once (if) the ribosome reaches the stop codon. Note that this model describes a much broader set (and shorter protein region) than Pfam model PF08053.

Catabolism of both of these monosaccharides results in lactaldehyde which is reduced by this enzyme to 1,2 propanediol [1].  This protein is alternatively known by the name 1,2 propanediol oxidoreductase.  This enzyme is active under anaerobic conditions in E. coli while being inactivated by reactive oxygen species under aerobic conditions [2].  Under aerobic conditions the lactaldehyde product of rhamnose and fucose catabolism is believed to be oxidized to lactate by a separate enzyme, lactaldehyde dehydrogenase.

CC  Thymidine phosphorylase (alternate name: pyrimidine phosphorylase), EC 2.4.2.4, is the designation for the enzyme of E. coli and other Proteobacteria involved in (deoxy)nucleotide degradation. It often occurs in an operon with a deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase, phosphopentomutase and a purine nucleoside phosphorylase. In many other lineages, the corresponding enzyme is designated pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.2); the naming convention imposed by this model represents standard literature practice.

A species may lack ribonuclease Z if all tRNA genes encode the CCA sequence, or if the CCA is exposed by exonuclease activity rather than endonuclease activity.

High levels of copper can displace zinc and prevent binding by the repressor, activating efflux by copper resistance transporters. The most closely related proteins excluded by this model are antibiotic resistance regulators including the methicillin resistance regulatory protein MecI.

In most species this protein exists as a fused alpha-beta domain polypeptide.  In Pyrococcus and related species, however the domains exist as separate polypeptides.  This model represents the alpha (N-terminal) domain.  In Pyrococcus and related species there appears to have been the development of a paralogous family such that four other proteins are close relatives.  In reference [1], one of these (along with its beta-domain partner) was characterized as ACS-II showing specificity for phenylacetyl-CoA.  This model has been constructed to exclude these non-ACS-I paralogs.  This may result in new, authentic ACS-I sequences falling below the trusted cutoff.

Function of bacterial proteins in this family was inferred originally from the known activity of eukaryotic homologs. Recently, activity was shown explicitly for the member from Mycoplasma pneumonia. Members of this family from alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria, designated ygfA, are often found in an operon with 6S structural RNA, and show a similar pattern of high expression during stationary phase. The function may be to deplete folate to slow 1-carbon biosynthetic metabolism.

This GTPase, related to the nucleolar protein Obg, is designated CgtA in bacteria. Mutations in this gene are pleiotropic, but it appears that effects on cellular functions such as chromosome partition may be secondary to the effect on ribosome structure. Recent work done in Vibrio cholerae shows an essential role in the stringent response, in which RelA-dependent ability to synthesize the alarmone ppGpp is required for deletion of this GTPase to be lethal.

This single enzyme is called the bacterial-type phytoene desaturase, or CrtI. Most members of this family, part of the larger Pfam family PF01593, which also contains amino oxidases, are CrtI itself; it is likely that all members act on either phytoene or on related compounds such as dehydrosqualene, for carotenoid biosynthesis.

Cryptochromes do not repair DNA and are presumed to act instead in some other (possibly unknown) process such as entraining circadian rhythms.

They may show weak photolyase activity in vitro but have not been shown to affect DNA repair in vivo.

CC  Members of this protein family are Ku proteins of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair in bacteria and in at least one member of the archaea (Archaeoglobus fulgidus). Most members are encoded by a gene adjacent to the gene for the DNA ligase that completes the repair. The NHEJ system is broadly but rather sparsely distributed, being present in about one fifth of the first 250 completed prokarytotic genomes. A few species (e.g. Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Bradyrhizobium japonicum) have multiple copies that appear to represent recent paralogous family expansion.

CC  DNA repair is accomplished by several different systems in prokaryotes. Recombinational repair of double-stranded DNA breaks involves the RecBCD pathway in some lineages, and AddAB (also called RexAB) in other. The AddA protein is conserved between the firmicutes and the alphaproteobacteria, while the partner protein is not. Nevertheless, the partner is designated AddB in both systems. This model describes the AddB protein as found Bacillus subtilis and related species. Although the RexB protein of Streptococcus and Lactococcus is considered to be orthologous, functionally equivalent, and merely named differently, all members of this protein family have a P-loop nucleotide binding motif GxxGxGK[ST] at the N-terminus, unlike RexB proteins, and a CxxCxxxxxC motif at the C-terminus, both of which may be relevant to function.

CC  Members of this protein family are DNA ligases involved in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The system of the bacterial Ku protein (TIGR02772) plus this DNA ligase is seen in about 20 % of bacterial genomes to date and at least one archaeon (Archeoglobus fulgidus). This model describes a central and a C-terminal domain. These two domains may be permuted, as in genus Mycobacterium, or divided into tandem ORFs, and therefore not be identified by this HMM. An additional N-terminal 3'-phosphoesterase (PE) domain present in some but not all examples of this ligase is not included in the seed alignment for this model; this HMM models only the central ATP-dependent ligase domain and the C-terminal polymerase domain. Most examples of genes for this ligase are adjacent to the gene for Ku.

LigD is variable in architecture, as it lacks this domain in Bacillus subtilis, is permuted in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and occasionally is encoded by tandem ORFs rather than as a multifuntional protein. In a few species (Dehalococcoides ethenogenes and the archaeal genus Methanosarcina), sequences corresponding to the ligase and polymerase domains of LigD are not found, and the role of this protein is unclear.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Three members of the seed for this model, from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Brucella melitensis, are found associated with a nickel ABC transporter operon that acts to import nickel for use as a cofactor in urease or hydrogenase. These proteins, with characterized nickel-binding and DNA-binding domains, act as nickel-responsive transcriptional regulators. In the larger family of full-length homologs, most others both lack proximity to the nickel ABC transporter operon and form a separate clade. Several of the homologs not within the scope of this model, but rather scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs, have been shown to bind nickel, copper, or both, and to regulate genes in response to nickel.

CC  TolA couples the inner membrane complex of itself with TolQ and TolR to the outer membrane complex of TolB and OprL (also called Pal). Most of the length of the protein consists of low-complexity sequence that may differ in both length and composition from one species to another, complicating efforts to discriminate TolA (the most divergent gene in the tol-pal system) from paralogs such as TonB. Selection of members of the seed alignment and criteria for setting scoring cutoffs are based largely conserved operon struction.  //The Tol-Pal complex is required for maintaining outer membrane integrity.  Also involved in transport (uptake) of colicins and filamentous DNA, and implicated in pathogenesis. Transport is energized by the proton motive force. TolA is an inner membrane protein that interacts with periplasmic TolB and with outer membrane porins ompC, phoE and lamB.

CC  TolQ is one of the essential components of the Tol-Pal system. Together with TolR, it harnesses protonmotive force to energize TolA, which spans the periplasm to reach the complex of TolB and Pal at the outer member. The tol-pal system proves to be important for maintaining outer membrane integrity. Gene pairs similar to the TolQ and TolR gene pair often number several per genome, but this model describes specificially TolQ per se, as found in tol-pal operons. A close homolog, excluded from this model, is ExbB of the ExbB/ExbD/TonB protein complex, which powers transport of siderophores and vitamin B12 across the bacterial outer membrane.  The Tol-Pal system is exploited by colicin and filamentous phage DNA to enter the cell. It is also implicated in pathogenesis in several bacterial species

CC  The tol-pal system consists of five critical genes. Inner membrane proteins TolQ and TolR convert protomotive force to energy that is transduced through TolA to an outer membrane complex of TolB and Pal. The system is known to be required to maintain outer membrane integrity. In a system with several homologous parts, ExbB and ExbD transduces energy through TonB to a variety of outer membrane proteins, many of which are siderophore receptors. The tol-pal system therefore may also be involved in transport. This family consists of a protein nearly always found in operons with the genes of the tol-pal system. The significance of this thioesterase to the tol-pal system is unclear, but either of two observations may be relevant. First, Pal, or peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein, has a conserved N-terminal cleavage and acylation that makes it a lipoprotein. Second, the tol-pal system is implicated not only in the import of certain organics but also in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity (by an unknown mechanism).

CC  Members of this protein family are the TolB periplasmic protein of Gram-negative bacteria. TolB is part of the Tol-Pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein) multiprotein complex, comprising five envelope proteins, TolQ, TolR, TolA, TolB and Pal, which form two complexes. The TolQ, TolR and TolA inner-membrane proteins interact via their transmembrane domains. The {beta}-propeller domain of the periplasmic protein TolB is responsible for its interaction with Pal. TolB also interacts with the outer-membrane peptidoglycan-associated proteins Lpp and OmpA. TolA undergoes a conformational change in response to changes in the proton-motive force, and interacts with Pal in an energy-dependent manner. The C-terminal periplasmic domain of TolA also interacts with the N-terminal domain of TolB.
CC   The Tol-PAL system is required for bacterial outer membrane integrity. E. coli TolB is involved in the tonB-independent uptake of group A colicins (colicins A, E1, E2, E3 and K), and is necessary for the colicins to reach their respective targets after initial binding to the bacteria. It is also involved in uptake of filamentous DNA.  Study of its structure suggest that the TolB protein might be involved in the recycling of peptidoglycan or in its covalent linking with lipoproteins.  The Tol-Pal system is also implicated in pathogenesis of E. coli, Haemophilus ducreyi , Salmonella enterica and Vibrio cholerae, but the mechanism(s) is unclear.

Members of this protein family have a tightly bound NAD that can act as a true cofactor, rather than a cosubstrate in dehydrogenase reactions, in dismutase reactions for some aldehydes. The name given to this family, however, is  formaldehyde dehydrogenase, glutathione-independent.

CC  Members of this family represent a set of radical SAM enzymes related to, yet architecturally different from, the activating protein for the glycine radical-containing, oxygen-sensitive ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (RNR) as described in model TIGR02491. Members of this family are found paired with members of a similarly divergent set of anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductases. Identification of this protein as an RNR activitating protein is partly from pairing with a candidate RNR. It is further supported by our finding that upstream of these operons are examples of a conserved regulatory element (described Rodionov and Gelfand) that is found in nearly all bacteria and that occurs specifically upstream of operons for all three classes of RNR genes.

These glycine-radical-containing enzymes are oxygen-sensitive and operate under anaerobic conditions. The genes for this family are pair with genes for an acitivating protein that creates a glycine radical. Members of this family, though related, fall outside the scope of TIGR02487, a functionally equivalent protein set; no genome has members in both familes. Identification as RNR is supported by gene pairing with the activating protein, lack of other anaerobic RNR, and presence of an upstream regulatory element strongly conserved upstream of most RNR operons.

CC  Bacillus and Clostridium species contain about 10 % dipicolinic acid (pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) by weight. This protein family, SpoVAD, belongs to the spoVA operon that is suggested to act in the transport of dipicolinic acid (DPA) from the mother cell, where DPA is synthesized, to the forespore, a process essential to sporulation. Members of this protein family are found, so far, in exactly those species believed capable of endospore formation.

CC  The sporulation-specific transcription factor sigma-K (also called sigma-27) is expressed in the mother cell compartment of endospore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis. Like its close homolog sigma-E (sigma-29) (see TIGR02835), also specific to the mother cell compartment, it must be activated by a proteolytic cleavage. Note that in Bacillus subtilis (and apparently also Clostridium tetani), but not in other endospore forming species such as Bacillus anthracis, the sigK gene is generated by a non-germline (mother cell only) chromosomal rearrangement that recombines coding regions for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of sigma-K.

CC  Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component of the aerobic respiratory chain which reacts with oxygen, reducing it to water with the concomitant transport of 4 protons across the membrane.  Also known as the cytochrome bo complex, cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase contains four subunits, two heme b cofactors and a copper atom which is believed to be the oxygen active site.  This complex is structurally related to the cytochrome caa3 oxidases which utilize cytochrome c as the reductant and contain heme a cofactors, as well as the intermediate form aa3 oxidases which also react directly with quinones as the reductant.

Recent work has shown that the transporter is involved in export of redox-active thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione [1,2].  The linkage to assembly of the cytochrome bd complex is further supported by the conserved operon structure found outside the gammaproteobacteria (cydABCD) containing both the transporter and oxidase genes components.

All members of this family scoring above trusted at the time of its creation were from genomes which encode a cytochrome bd complex.

PdaA acts immediately after CwlD, an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and performs a de-N-acetylation. PdaA may also perform the following transpeptidation for lactam ring formation, as heterologous expression in E. coli of CwlD and PdaA together is sufficient for delta-lactam production.

CC  This large family represents subunit I's (CtaD, CoxA, CaaA) of cytochrome c oxidases of bacterial origin.  Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Subunits I-III form the functional core of the enzyme complex.  Subunit I is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme.  Electrons originating in cytochrome c are transferred via the copper A center of subunit II and heme a of subunit I to the bimetallic center formed by heme a3 and copper B. This cytochrome c oxidase shows proton pump activity across the membrane in addition to the electron transfer.
CC  In the bacilli an apparent split (paralogism) has created a sister clade (TIGR02882) encoding subunits (QoxA) of the aa3-type quinone oxidase complex which reacts directly with quinones, bypassing the interaction with soluble cytochrome c.  This model attempts to exclude these sequences, placing them between the trusted and noise cutoffs.

Sigma-I was shown to be induced by heat shock (PMID:11157964) in Bacillus subtilis and is suggested by its phylogenetic profile to be connected to the program of sporulation (PMID:16311624).

CC  SafA (YrbB) (SafA) of Bacillus subtilis is a protein found at the interface of the spore cortex and spore coat, and is dependent on SpoVID for its localization. This model is based on the N-terminal LysM (lysin motif) domain (see PFAM model PF01476) of SafA and, from several other spore-forming species, the protein with the most similar N-terminal region. However, this set of proteins differs greatly in C-terminal of the LysM domaim; blocks of 12-residue and 13-residue repeats are found in the Bacillus cereus group, tandem LysM domains in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4, etc.

CC  Members of this protein are LonB, a paralog of the ATP-dependent protease La (LonA, TIGR00763). LonB proteins are found strictly, and almost universally, in endospore-forming bacteria. This protease was shown, in Bacillus subtilis, to be expressed specifically in the forespore, during sporulation, under control of sigma(F). The lonB gene, despite location immediately upstream of lonA, was shown to be monocistronic. LonB appears able to act on sigma(H) for post-translation control, but lonB mutation did not produce an obvious sporulation defect under the conditions tested. Note that additional paralogs of LonA and LonB occur in the Clostridium lineage and this model selects only one per species as the protein that corresponds to LonB in B. subtilis.

CC  Members of this protein family, found in eighteen genera so far, have a PEP-CTERM sequence at the carboxyl-terminus (see model TIGR02595), but are unusual among PEP-CTERM proteins in having multiple predicted transmembrane segments. The function is unknown.  It is proposed that an exosortase (see TIGR02602), recognizes and cleaves PEP-CTERM proteins in a manner analogous to the cleavage of LPXTG proteins by sortase (see Haft, et al., 2006). In at least six species, a gene encoding what appears to be a dedicated (single target) exosortase is adjacent. In that subset, the PEP-CTERM motif takes the form VPEPxxWxL.

This enzyme hydrolyzes allantoate to (S)-ureidoglycolate and urea; it can also degrade (R)-ureidoglycolate to glyoxylate and urea. Allantoinase (EC 3.5.2.5) hydrolyzes (S)-allantoin (a xanthine metabolite, via urate) to allantoate. Allantoate can then be degraded either by this enzyme, allantoicase, or by allantoate deiminase (EC 3.5.3.9).  Members of the seed alignment for this model were taken from BRENDA. Proteins in this family contain two copies of the allantoicase repeat (PF03561).

In eukaryotes, a clade separate from the transthyretins (a family of thyroid-hormone binding proteins) has also been shown to have HIU hydrolase activity in urate catabolizing organisms [2].  Transthyretin, then, would appear to be the recently diverged paralog of the more ancient HIUH family.

CC  The CAAX prenyl protease, in eukaryotes, catalyzes three covalent modifications, including cleavage and acylation, at the C-terminus of certain proteins in a process connected to protein sorting. This family describes a bacterial protein family homologous to one domain of the CAAX-processing enzyme. Members of this protein family are found in genomes that carry a predicted protein sorting system, PEP-CTERM/exosortase, usually in the vicinity of the EpsH homolog that is the hallmark of the system. The function of this protein is unknown, but it may relate to protein motification.

CC  The three proteins TusB, TusC, and TusD form a heterohexamer responsible for a sulfur relay reaction. In large numbers of proteobacterial species, this complex acts on a Cys-derived persulfide moiety, delivered by the cysteine desulfurase IscS to TusA, then to TusBCD. The activated sulfur group is then transferred to TusE (DsrC), then by MnmA (TrmU) for modification of an anticodon nucleotide in tRNAs for Glu, Lys, and Gln. The sulfur relay complex TusBCD is also found, under the designation DsrEFH, in phototrophic and chemotrophic sulfur bacteria, such as Chromatium vinosum. In these organisms, it seems the primary purpose is related to sulfur flux, such as oxidation from sulfide to molecular sulfur to sulfate.

CC  Members of this protein family belong to the family of bacterial sugar transferases (PF02397).  Nearly all are found in species that encode the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system predicted to act in protein sorting in a number of Gram-negative bacteria (notable exceptions appear to include Magnetococcus sp. MC-1 and Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622 ).  These genes are generally found near one or more of the PrsK, PrsR or PrsT genes that have been related to the PEP-CTERM system by phylogenetic profiling methods [1].  The nature of the sugar transferase reaction catalyzed by members of this clade is unknown and may conceivably be variable with respect to substrate by species.  These proteins are homologs of the EpsB protein found in Methylobacillus sp. strain 12S [2], which is also associated with a PEP-CTERM system, but of a distinct type.  A name which appears attached to a number of genes (by transitive annotation) in this family is "undecaprenyl-phosphate galactose phosphotransferase", which comes from relatively distant characterized enterobacterial homologs, and is considerably more specific than warranted from the currently available evidence.

CC  The WbaP (formerly RfbP) protein has been characterized [1,2] as the first enzyme in O-antigen biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium.  The enzyme transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to a polyprenyl carrier (utilizing the highly conserved C-terminal sugar transferase domain, PF02397) a reaction which takes place at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane.  The N-terminal hydrophobic domain is then believed to facilitate the "flippase" function of transferring the liposaccharide unit from the cytoplasmic face to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane.  
CC  This model includes the enterobacterial enzymes, where the function is presumed to be identical to the S. typhimurium enzyme as well as a somewhat broader group which are likely to catalyze the same or highly similar reactions based on a phylogenetic tree-building analysis of the broader sugar transferase family.  Most of these genes are found within large operons dedicated to the production of complex exopolysaccharides such as the enterobacterial O-antigen.  The most likely heterogeneity would be in the precise nature of the sugar molecule transferred.

CC  This family of proteins encompasses the E. coli WcaJ protein involved in colanic acid biosynthesis [1], the Methylobacillus EpsB protein involved in methanolan biosynthesis [2], as well as the GumD protein involved in the biosynthesis of xanthan [3].  All of these are closely related to the well-characterized WbaP (formerly RfbP) protein [4] which is the first enzyme in O-antigen biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium.  The enzyme transfers galactose from UDP-galactose (NOTE: not glucose) to a polyprenyl carrier (utilizing the highly conserved C-terminal sugar transferase domain, PF02397) a reaction which takes place at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane.  The N-terminal hydrophobic domain is then believed to facilitate the "flippase" function of transferring the liposaccharide unit from the cytoplasmic face to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane.
CC  Most of these genes are found within large operons dedicated to the production of complex exopolysaccharides such as the enterobacterial O-antigen.  
CC  Colanic acid biosynthesis utilizes a glucose-undecaprenyl carrier [1], knockout of EpsB abolishes incorporation of UDP-glucose into the lipid phase [2] and the C-terminal portion of GumD has been shown to be responsible for the glucosyl-1-transferase activity [3].

CC  Members of this family are generally found near other genes involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of exopolysaccharides.  These proteins consist of two fused domains, an N-terminal hydrophobic domain of generally low conservation and a highly conserved C-terminal sugar transferase domain (PF02397).  Characterized and partially characterized members of this subfamily include Salmonella WbaP (originally RfbP) [1], E. coli WcaJ [2], Methylobacillus EpsB [3], Xanthomonas GumD [4], Vibrio CpsA [5], Erwinia AmsG [6], Group B Streptococcus CpsE (originally CpsD) [7], and Streptococcus suis Cps2E [8].  Each of these is believed to act in transferring the sugar from, for instance, UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose, to a lipid carrier such as undecaprenyl phosphate as the first (priming) step in the synthesis of an oligosaccharide "block".  This function is encoded in the C-terminal domain.  The liposaccharide is believed to be subsequently transferred through a "flippase" function from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane by the N-terminal domain.  
CC  Certain closely related transferase enzymes such as Sinorhizobium ExoY [9] and Lactococcus EpsD [10] lack the N-terminal domain and are not found by this model.

CC  Enzymes in this family catalyze the NAD-dependent alcohol-to-acid oxidation of nucleotide-linked sugars.  Examples include UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (1.1.1.22) [1], GDP-mannose 6-dehydrogenase (1.1.1.132) [2], UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 6-dehydrogenase (1.1.1.136) [3], UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase [4] and UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase [5].  These enzymes are most often involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and are often found in operons devoted to that purpose.
CC  All of these enzymes contain three Pfam domains, PF03721, PF00984, and PF03720 for the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions respectively.

CC  Sequences in this family of proteins are members of a polysaccharide export protein family (PF02563) which includes the wza [1] protein from E.coli.  This family of proteins are homologous to the EpsE protein of the methanolan biosynthesis operon of Methylobacillus species strain 12S [2].  The distribution of this protein appears to be restricted to a subset of exopolysaccharide operons containing a syntenic grouping of genes including a variant of the EpsH exosortase protein [2].  Exosortase has been proposed to be involved in the targetting and processing of proteins containing the PEP-CTERM domain to the exopolysaccharide layer [3].

CC  Cellulose synthase catalyzes the beta-1,4 polymerization of glucose residues in the formation of cellulose.  In bacteria, the substrate is UDP-glucose.  The synthase consists of two subunits (or domains in the frequent cases where it is encoded as a single polypeptide), the catalytic domain modelled here and the regulatory domain (PF03170).  The regulatory domain binds the allosteric activator cyclic di-GMP.  The protein is membrane-associated and probably assembles into multimers such that the individual cellulose strands can self-assemble into multi-strand fibrils.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  One of several pathways of tryptophan degradation is as follows: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (1.13.11.11) uses 02 to convert Trp to L-formylkynurenine. Arylformamidase (3.5.1.9) hydrolyzes the product to L-kynurenine and formate. Kynureninase (3.7.1.3) hydrolyzes L-kynurenine to anthranilate plus alanine. Members of the seed alignment for this model are bacterial predicted metal-dependent hydrolases. All are supported as arylformamidase (3.5.1.9) by an operon structure in which kynureninase and/or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase genes are adjacent. The members from Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia metallidurans were characterized. An example from Pseudomonas fluorescens is given the gene symbol qbsH instead of kynB because of its role in quinolobactin biosynthesis, which begins with tryptophan. All members of this family should be arylformamidase (3.5.1.9).

Members often are encoded in the same operon as subunits of the protoporphyrin IX magnesium chelatase, and were once designated BchO.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This model represents a 28-column alignment, comprising four tandem sets of seven residues each, in which the fourth residue tends to be Leu and the seventh tends to be Gly in each set. This heptad periodicity, corresponding to two turns of an alpha helix, suggests alpha-helical structure; in many proteins this 28-region model hits many times in tandem. Arrangement of these sequences on a helical wheel would show a strict alternation of Leu and Gly residues on one side of the helix, that is, an extremely bulky side chain alternating with the virtual absence of one. This suggests an extended zippering of one alpha helix to another, analogous to the shorter leucine zippers found in many dimerizing transcription factors. Proteins in which these heptad repeats occur often have higher order repeats of a unit comprised of several heptads.

The protein family represented here reflects subunit A of both the particulate methane monooxygenase of methylotrophs and the ammonia monooxygenase of nitrifying bacteria.

CC  Members of this protein family are the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (EC 5.1.99.1), also called methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. This enzyme converts (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then a substrate for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (TIGR00642). It is known in bacteria, archaea, and as a mitochondrial protein in animals. It is closely related to lactoylglutathione lyase (TIGR00068), which is also called glyoxylase I, and is also a homodimer.

CC  The model describes a hydrophobic sequence region that is duplicated to form the AbrB protein of Escherichia coli (not to be confused with a Bacillus subtilis protein with the same gene symbol). In some species, notably the Cyanobacteria and Thermus thermophilus, proteins consist of a single copy rather than two copies. The member from Pseudomonas putida, PP_1415, was suggested to be an ammonia monooxygenase characteristic of heterotrophic nitrifiers, based on an experimental indication of such activity in the organism and a glimmer of local sequence similarity between parts of P. putida protein and an instance of the AmoA protein from Nitrosomonas europaea (PMID:9732537); we do not believe the sequence similarity to be meaningful. The member from E. coli (b0715, ybgN) appears to be the largely uncharacterized AbrB (aidB regulator) protein of E. coli cited in Volkert, et al. (PMID 8002588), although we did not manage to trace the origin of association of the article to the sequence.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This protein family pulls together several groups of proteins, each very different from the others. They share in common three conserved regions. The first is a region of about 38 amino acids, nearly always at the N-terminus of a protein. This region has a bulky hydrophobic residue, usually Trp, at position 29, and a His residue at position 37 that is invariant, so far, in over 150 instances. The second conserved region has a motif [DE]xxxHxxD. The third conserved region contains a hydrophobic patch and a well-conserved Arg residue. Most examples are found in the Actinobacteria, including the genera Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium, Streptomyces, Nocardia, Frankia, etc. The pattern of near-invariant residues against a backdrop of extreme sequence divergence suggests enzymatic activity and conservation of active site residues.

CC  The predicted protein-sorting transpeptidase that we call exosortase (see TIGR02602) has distinct subclasses that associated with different types of exopolysaccharide production loci. This model represents a distinct clade among a set of amidotransferases largely annotated (not necessarily accurately) as glutatime-hydrolyzing asparagine synthases. Members of this clade are essentially restricted to the characteristic exopolysaccharide (EPS) regions that contain the exosortase 1 genome (xrtA), in genomes that also have numbers of PEP-CTERM domain (TIGR02595) proteins.

This protein appears related to the conserved core region of a family of proposed transpeptidases, exosortase (previously EpsH), thought to act on PEP-CTERM proteins. Members of the seed alignment include all exosortase proposed active site residues. However, in contrast to canonical exosortase (TIGR02602) and archaeal (TIGR03762), and cyanobacterial (TIGR03763) variants, this family has not yet been matched to a cognate PEP-CTERM-like sorting signal.

The epsilon subunit is closely related to the malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein (ACP) transacylase family described by TIGR00128, but acts on an ACP subunit of malonate decarboxylase that has an unusual coenzyme A derivative as its prothetic group.

CC  3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 2 (KAS-II, FabF) is involved in the condensation step of fatty acid biosynthesis in which the malonyl donor group is decarboxylated and the resulting carbanion used to attack and extend the acyl group attached to the acyl carrier protein [1].  Most genomes encoding fatty acid biosynthesis contain a number of condensing enzymes, often of all three types: 1, 2 and 3.  Synthase 2 is mechanistically related to synthase 1 (KAS-I, FabB) containing a number of absolutely conserved catalytic residues in common [2].
CC  This model is based primarily on genes which are found in apparent operons with other essential genes of fatty acid biosynthesis (GenProp0681).  The large gap between the trusted cutoff and the noise cutoff contains many genes which are not found adjacent to genes of the fatty acid pathway in genomes that often also contain a better hit to this model.  These genes may be involved in other processes such as polyketide biosyntheses.  Some genomes contain more than one above-trusted hit to this model which may result from recent paralogous expansions.  Second hits to this model which are not next to other fatty acid biosynthesis genes may be involved in other processes.
CC  FabB sequences should fall well below the noise cutoff of this model.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This highly divergent, uncharacterized domain has several absolutely conserved residues, including a QR pair and FxxxN motif. Its most striking feature, however, is a near invariant pentapeptide motif DGQHR. Several different subfamilies occur specifically as a part of DNA phosphorothioation systems, previously called DND (DNA instability during electrophoresis), while others (e.g.  CPS_2936) occur in other contexts suggestive of lateral gene transfer (sporadic distribution of helicase-containing cassettes). The region described by this model is about 280 amino acids in length; additional sequences show local sequence similarity.

This protein is found in the vicinity of genes involved in the catabolism of allantoin, a breakdown product of urate and sometimes of urate iteslf.  The distribution of pathway components in the genomes in which this family is observed suggests that the function is linked to the allantoate catabolism to glyoxylate pathway (GenProp0686) since it is sometimes found in genomes lacking any elements of the xanthine-to-allantoin pathways (e.g. in Enterococcus faecalis).

In fact, 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate aldolase is a synonym for this enzyme as it is unclear in the literature whether the enzyme acts on only one of these or, as seems likely, has no preference.  (Despite the apparent large difference in substrate stucture indicated by their names, 2-DH-3DO- and 5-DH-4DO-glucarate differ only by the chirality of most central hydroxyl-bearing carbon and is alternately named 2-DH-3DO-galactarate.)  The reported product of D-galactarate dehydratase (4.2.1.42) is the 5DH-4DO-glucarate isomer and this enzyme is found proximal to the aldolase in many genomes (GenProp0714) where no epimerase is known.  Similarly, the product of D-glucarate dehydratase (4.2.1.40) is again the 5-DH-4DO isomer, so the provenance of the 2-DH-3DO-glucarate isomer for which this enzyme is named is unclear.

In a few species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the member of this family is encoded adjacent to a paralog, and the two polypeptides form a heterodimeric enzyme, active on both arginine and ornithine. In such species, this polypeptide may be treated as the beta subunit of an enzyme that may be named either arginine N-succinyltransferase (AST) or arginine and orthithine N-succinyltransferase (AOST).

All seed alignment sequences are found within arginine succinyltransferase operons, and all proteins that score above 820.0 bits should function as succinylornithine transaminase. However, a number of sequences extremely closely related in sequence, found in different genomic contexts, are likely to act in different biological processes and may act on different substrates.

JS666 in close proximity to the PhnW gene (TIGR02326) encoding 2-aminoethyl phosphonate aminotransferase (which generates phosphonoacetaldehyde) and PhnA (TIGR02335) encoding phosphonoacetate hydrolase (not to be confused with the alkylphosphonate utilization operon protein PhnA modeled by TIGR00686).  Additionally,  transporters believed to be specific for 2-aminoethyl phosphonate are often present.  
CC  PhnW is, in other organisms, coupled with PhnX (TIGR01422) for the degradation of phosphonoacetaldehyde (GenProp0238), but PhnX is apparently absent in each of the organisms containing this aldehyde reductase.
CC  PhnA, characterized in a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens that has not het been genome sequenced, is only rarely found outside of the PhnW and aldehyde dehydrogenase context.  For instance in Rhodopseudomonas and Bordetella bronchiseptica, where it is adjacent to transporters presumably specific for the import of phosphonoacetate.
CC  It seems reasonably certain then, that this enzyme catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of phosphonoacetaldehyde to phosphonoacetate, bridging the metabolic gap between PhnW and PhnA.  We propose the name phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase and the gene symbol PhnY for this enzyme.

Proteins from this clade are found in genome sequence if and only if the species sequenced is one of the methanogens. All methanogens belong to the archaea; some but not all of those sequenced are hyperthermophiles. This protein family was detected by the method of partial phylogenetic profiling (see Haft, et al., 2006).

Some members have been suggested to be a methyltransferase, based on the proximity of its gene to genes of the multi-subunit complex, N5-methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin--coenzyme M methyltransferase. That context is not conserved, however. The family shows similarity to various phosphate acyltranferases.

CC  Thymidylate synthase makes dTMP for DNA synthesis, and is among the most widely distributed of all enzymes. Members of this protein family are encoded within a completed genome sequence if and only if that species is one of the methanogenenic archaea. In these species, tetrahydromethanopterin replaces tetrahydrofolate, The member from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was shown to behave as a thymidylate synthase based on similar side reactions (the exchange of a characteristic proton with water), although the full reaction was not reconstituted. Partial sequence data showed no similarity to known thymidylate synthases simply because the region sequenced was from a distinctive  N-terminal region not found in other thymidylate synthases. Members of this protein family appear, therefore, to a novel, tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent thymidylate synthase.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This family consists of examples of phosphonopyruvate  an decarboxylase enzyme that produces phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald), the second step in the biosynthesis phosphonate-containing compounds.  Since the preceding enzymate step, PEP phosphomutase (AepX, TIGR02320) favors the substrate PEP energetically, the decarboxylase is required to drive the reaction in the direction of phosphonate production.  Pald is a precursor of natural products including antibiotics like bialaphos [1] and phosphonothricin [2] in Streptomyces species, phosphonate-modified molecules such as the polysaccharide B of Bacteroides fragilis [3], the phosphonolipids of Tetrahymena pyroformis [4], the glycosylinositolphospholipids of Trypanosoma cruzi [5].  This gene generally occurs in prokaryotic organisms adjacent to the gene for AepX.  Most often an aminotansferase (aepZ) is also present which leads to the production of the most common phosphonate compound, 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP).

CC  This family includes a number of 2-aminoethylphosphonate aminotransferases, some of which are indicated to operate in the catabolism of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) and others which are involved in the biosynthesis of the same compound.  The catabolic enzyme (PhnW, [1]) is known to use pyruvate:alanine as the transfer partner and is modeled by the equivalog-level HMM (TIGR02326).  The PhnW family is apparently a branch of a larger tree including genes (AepZ) adjacent to others responsible for the biosynthesis of phosphonoacetaldehyde [2].  The identity of the transfer partner  is unknown for these enzymes and considering the reversed flux compared to PhnW, it may very well be different.

CC  This hidden Markov model detects a 10-residue targeting sequence common to beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMP) that rely on Omp85-like proteins for insertion into the outer membrane. Hits should be trusted if they include the last amino acid of a protein sequence that occurs in Gram-negative bacteria. It has been noted that Omp85 target sequences differ somewhat by species, while this model works generally for most Proteobacteria. For a given species, an iterated approach, in which trusted matches to this model become the basis of a new model that finds additional OMP signals, is recommended. Note that this model does not work well under HMMER3, but works better under HMMER2 when the model is built with the -g option from the seed alignment.

Homologs of YgfZ other than members of the GcvT family share a well-conserved signature region that includes the motif, KGCYxGQE. Elsewhere, sequence diverge and length variation are substantial. Members of this family are mostly bacterial, largely absent from the Firmicutes and otherwise usually present. A few eukaryotic examples are found among the Apicomplexa, and a few archaeal sequences are found. Two functions implicated for this folate-binding protein are RNA modification (a function likely to be conserved) and replication initiation (a function likely to be highly variable). Many members of this family are, at the time of construction of this model, misnamed as the glycine cleavage system T protein.

CC  This clade of sequences are members of the PF01266 family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases.  Characterized proteins within this family include glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.1.99.5), sarcosine oxidase beta subunit (1.5.3.1) and a number of deaminating amino acid oxidases (1.4.-.-). These genes have been consistently observed in a genomic context including genes for the import and catabolism of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP).  If the substrate of this oxidoreductase is AEP itself, then it is probably acting in the manner of a deaminating oxidase, resulting in the same product (phosphonoacetaldehyde) as the transaminase PhnW (TIGR02326), but releasing ammonia instead of coupling to pyruvate:alanine.  Alternatively, it is reasonable to suppose that the various ABC cassette transporters which are also associated with these loci allow the import of phosphonates closely related to AEP which may not be substrates for PhnW.

These multi-subunit enzymes typically are found in anaerobes and are inactiviated by oxygen. IOR in Pyrococcus acts in fermentation of all three aromatic amino acids, following removal of the amino group by transamination. In Methanococcus maripaludis, by contrast, IOR acts in the opposite direction, in pathways of amino acid biosynthesis from phenylacetate, indoleacetate, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate. In M. maripaludis and many other species, iorA and iorB are found next to an apparent phenylacetate-CoA ligase.

EN  phosphonatase-like hydrolase
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This clade of sequences are the closest homologs to the PhnX enzyme, phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald) hydrolase (phosphonatase, TIGR01422).  This phosphonatase-like enzyme and PhnX itself are members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily (PF00702) having a a number of distinctive features that set them apart from typical HAD enzymes.  The typical HAD N-terminal motif DxDx(T/V) here is DxAGT and the usual conserved lysine prior to the C-terminal motif is instead an arginine.  Also distinctive of phosphonatase, and particular  to its bi-catalytic mechanism is a conserved lysine in the variable "cap" domain [1].  This lysine forms a Schiff base with the aldehyde of phosphonoacetaldehyde, providing, through the resulting positive charge, a polarization of the C-P bond necesary for cleavage as well as a route to the initial product of cleavage, an ene-amine.  The conservation of these elements in this phosphonatase-like enzyme suggests that the substrate is also, like Pald, a 2-oxo-ethylphosphonate.  Despite this, the genomic context of members of this family are quite distinct from PhnX, which is almost invariably associated with the 2-aminoethylphosphonate transaminase PhnW (TIGR02326), the source of the substrate Pald.  Members of this clade are never associated with PhnW, but rather associate with families of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases related to deaminating amino acid oxidases (PF01266) as well as zinc-dependent dehydrogenases (PF00107).  Notably, family members from Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 and Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 are adjacent to the PhnCDE ABC cassette phosphonates transporter (GenProp0236) typically found in association with the phosphonates C-P lyase system (GenProp0232).  These observations suggest two possibilities.  First, the substrate for this enzyme family is also Pald, the non-association with PhnW not withstanding.  Alternatively, the substrate is something very closely related such as hydroxyphosphonoacetaldehyde (Hpald).  Hpald could come from oxidative deamination of 1-hydroxy-2-aminoethylphosphonate (HAEP) by the associated oxidase.  HAEP would not be a substrate for PhnW due to its high specificity for AEP.  HAEP has been shown to be a constituent of the sphingophosphonolipid of Bacteriovorax stolpii [3], and presumably has other natural sources.  If Hpald is the substrate, the product would be glycoaldehyde (hydroxyacetaldehyde), and the associated alcohol dehydrogenase may serve to convert this to glycol.

CC  This protein, called BcsE (bacterial cellulose synthase E) or YhjS, is required for cellulose biosynthesis in Salmonella enteritidis. Its role is this process across multiple bacterial species is implied by the partial phylogenetic profiling algorithm. Members are found in the vicinity of other cellulose biosynthesis genes. The model does not include a much less well-conserved N-terminal region about 150 amino acids in length for most members. Solano, et al. suggest this protein acts as a protease.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  A probable protein export sorting signal, PEP-CTERM, was described by Haft, et al. (PMID:16930487). It is predicted to interact with a putative transpeptidase we designate exosortase. This model describes a variant with conserved motif VPLPA, rather than VPEP. It appears to be the recognition sequences for exosortase D (TIGR04152). This variant is found prominently in two members of the Rhodobacterales, namely Jannaschia sp. CCS1 and Roseobacter denitrificans OCh 114. One interesting member protein has a full-length duplication and therefore two copies of this putative sorting domain.

CC  Members of this family are the YhjQ protein, found immediately upsteam of bacterial cellulose synthase (bcs) genes in a broad range of bacteria, including both copies of the bcs locus in Klebsiella pneumoniae. In several species it is seen clearly as part of the bcs operon. It is identified as a probable component of the bacterial cellulose metabolic process not only by gene location, but also by partial phylogenetic profiling, or Haft-Selengut algorithm (PMID:16930487), based on a bacterial cellulose biosynthesis genome property profile. Cellulose plays an important role in biofilm formation and structural integrity in some bacteria. Mutants in yhjQ in Escherichia coli, show altered morphology an growth, but the function of YhjQ has not yet been determined.

CC  Type I protein secretion is a system in some Gram-negative bacteria to export proteins (often proteases) across both inner and outer membranes to the extracellular medium. This is one of three proteins of the type I secretion apparatus. Targeted proteins are not cleaved at the N-terminus, but rather carry signals located toward the extreme C-terminus to direct type I secretion. This model is related to models TIGR01842 and TIGR01846, and to bacteriocin ABC transporters that cleave their substrates during export.

CC  Members of this protein family are bacterial, phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C enzymes, with a characteristic domain architecture as found in hemolytyic (PlcH) and nonhemolytic (PlcN) secreted enzymes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PlcH hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to diacylglycerol and phosphocholine, but unlike PlcN can also hydrolyze sphingomyelin to ceramide ((N-acylsphingosine)) and phosphocholine. Members of this family share the twin-arginine signal sequence for Sec-independent transport across the plasma membrane. PlcH is secreted as a heterodimer with a small chaperone, PlcR, encoded immediately downstream.

NifS is part of the NIF system, usually associated with other nif genes involved in nitrogenase expression and nitrogen fixation. The protein family is given a fairly broad interpretation here. It includes a clade nearly always found in extended nitrogen fixation genomic regions, plus a second clade more closely related to the first than to IscS and also part of NifS-like/NifU-like systems. This model does not extend to a more distantly clade found in the epsilon proteobacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, also named NifS in the literature, built instead in TIGR03403.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This small clade of iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases of the PF00465 family is found in genomic contexts indicating a role in the metabolism of phosphonates.  In Delftia acidovorans SPH-1, the gene ZP_01580650.1 is adjacent to and running in the same direction as ZP_01580649.1 encoding the enzyme phosphonatase (PhnX, TIGR01422).  Upstream are also found genes encoding components of a phosphonate ABC transport complex.  In Ralstonia eutropha H16 and Verminephrobacter eiseniae EF01-2 the dehydrogenase is followed by a homolog of the PhnB gene, a putative phosphonate-specific MFS-type transporter.  In Azoarcus BH72 the gene is preceded by Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase (aepX) and a putative phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase (aepY), two genes involved in the biosynthesis of phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald).  Ususally these two are accompanied by a specific transaminase, AepZ, which converts Pald to 2-aminoethylphosphonate (2-AEP).
CC  2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (2-HEP), the presumed product of the reaction of Pald with an alcohol dehydrogenase, is a biologically novel but reasonable analog of 2-AEP and may be a constituent of as-yet undescribed natural products.  In the case of Azoarcus, downstream of the dehydrogenase is a CDP-glycerol:glycerophosphate transferase homolog that may indicate the existence of a pathway for 2-HEP-derived phosphonolipid biosynthesis.

CC  The function is unknown for this protein family, but members are found almost always in operons for the the SUF system of iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. The SUF system is present elsewhere on the chromosome for those few species where SUF genes are not adjacent. This family shares this property of association with the SUF system with a related family, TIGR02945. TIGR02945 consists largely of a DUF59 domain (see Pfam family PF01883), while this protein is about double the length, with a unique N-terminal domain and DUF59 C-terminal domain. A location immediately downstream of the cysteine desulfurase gene sufS in many contexts suggests the gene symbol sufT. Note that some other homologs of this family and of TIGR02945, but no actual members of this family, are found in operons associated with phenylacetic acid (or other ring-hydroxylating) degradation pathways.

Members of this particular branch typically are found, almost half the time, near the mnmA gene, involved in the carboxymethylaminomethyl modification of U34 in some tRNAs (see GenProp0704). While other NifU proteins are associated with nitrogen fixation, this family is not.

CC  Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and related species use the thiol mycothiol in place of glutathione. This enzyme, homologous to the (dispensible) MshB enzyme of mycothiol biosynthesis, is described as an amidase that acts on conjugates to mycothiol. It is a detoxification enzyme.

CC  This family of CoA transferases includes enzymes catalyzing at least two related but distinct activities.  The E. coli YgfH protein has been characterized as a propionyl-CoA:succinate CoA transferase [1] where it appears to be involved in a pathway for the decarboxylation of succinate to propionate.  The Clostridium kluyveri CAT1 protein has been characterized as a acetyl-CoA:succinate CoA transferase [2] and is believed to be involved in anaerobic succinate degradation.
CC  The propionate:succinate transferase activity has been reported in the propionic acid fermentation of propionibacterium species [3] where it is distinct from the coupled activities of distinct nucleotide-triphosphate dependent succinate and propionate/acetate CoA transferases (as inferred from activity in the absence of NTPs).  The family represented by this model includes a member from Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202 which is likely to be responsible for this activity.
CC  A closely related clade not included in this family are the Ach1p proteins of fungi which are acetyl-CoA hydrolases [4].  This name has been applied to many of the proteins modeled by this HMM, possibly erroneously.

CC  This domain is often repeated twice within the same polypeptide, as is observed in Archaea, Thermus, Sphingobacteria [1] and Fungi.  In the fungal sequences, this tandem domain pair is observed as the N-terminal half of a bifunctional protein [2], where it has been characterized as a lycopene beta-cyclase and the C-terminal half is a phytoene synthetase.  In Myxococcus and Actinobacterial genomes this domain appears as a single polypeptide, tandemly repeated and usually in a genomic context consistent with a role in carotenoid biosynthesis.  It is unclear whether any of the sequences in this family truly encode lycopene epsilon cyclases. However a number are annotated as such.

Continuing past SHC are found a phosphorylase enzyme (ZMO0873, i.e. HpnG, TIGR03468) and this radical SAM enzyme (ZMO0874) which we name here HpnH.  Granted, in Z. mobilis, HpnH is in a convergent orientation with respect to HpnA-G, but one gene beyond HpnH and running in the same convergent direction is IspH (ZM0875, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase), an essential enzyme of IPP biosynthesis and therefore essential for the biosynthesis of hopanoids.  One of the well-described hopanoid intermediates is bacteriohopanetetrol.  In the conversion from hopene several reactions must occur in the side chain for which a radical mechanism might be reasonable.  These include the four (presumably anaerobic) hydroxylations and a methyl shift.

CC  The sequences represented by this model are members of the radical SAM superfamily of enzymes (PF04055).  These enzymes utilize an iron-sulfur redox cluster and S-adenosylmethionine to carry out diverse radical mediated reactions [1].  The member of this clade from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (AFE_0975) is found in the same locus as squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC, TIGR01507) and other genes associated with the biosynthesis of hopanoid natural products.  Similarly, in Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (Reut_B4901) this gene is adjacent to HpnAB, IspH and HpnH (TIGR03470), although SHC itself is elsewhere in the genome.  Notably, this gene (here named HpnJ) and three others form a conserved set (HpnIJKL) which occur in a subset of all genomes containing the SHC enzyme.  This relationship was discerned using the method of partial phylogenetic profiling [2].  This group includes Zymomonas mobilis, the organism where the initial hopanoid biosynthesis locus was described consisting of the genes HpnA-E and SHC (HpnF) [3].  Continuing past SHC are found a phosphorylase enzyme (ZMO0873, i.e. HpnG, TIGR03468) and another radical SAM enzyme (ZMO0874), HpnH.  Although discontinuous in Z. mobilis, we continue the gene symbol sequence with HpnIJKL.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This homology domain, GlyGly-CTERM, shares a species distribution with rhombosortase (TIGR03902), a subfamily of rhomboid-like intramembrane serine proteases. It is probably a recognition sequence for protein sorting and then cleavage by rhombosortase. Shewanella species have the largest number of target proteins per genome, up to thirteen. The domain occurs at the extreme carboxyl-terminus of a diverse set of proteins, most of which are enzymes with conventional signal sequences and with hydrolytic activities: nucleases, proteases, agarases, etc. The agarase AgaA from Vibro sp. strain JT0107 is secreted into the medium, while the same protein heterologously expressed in E. coli is retained in the cell fraction. This suggests cleavage and release in species with this domain. Both this suggestion, and the chemical structure of the domain (motif, hydrophobic predicted transmembrane helix, cluster of basic residues) closely parallels that of the LPXTG/sortase system and the PEP-CTERM/exosortase(EpsH) system. For this reason, the putative processing enzyme is designated rhombosortase.

The major differences between these genes are architectural, with variable central sections between relatively conserved N- and C-terminal domains.  More distantly related are two other flagellar apparatus familis, FlgC (TIGR01395) which consists of little else but the N-and C-terminal domains and FlgK (TIGR02492) with a substantial but different central domain.

Not all Bacteroidetes with members of this protein family appear to have all of the genes associated with gliding motility and in fact some do not appear to express the gliding phenotype.

CC  SelD, selenophosphate synthase, is the selenium donor protein for both selenocysteine and selenouridine biosynthesis systems, but it occurs also in a few prokaryotes that have neither of those pathways. The method of partial phylogenetic profiling [1], starting from such orphan-selD genomes, identifies this protein as one of those most strongly correlated to SelD occurrence. Its distribution is also well correlated with that of family TIGR03309, a putative accessory protein of labile selenium (non-selenocysteine) enzyme maturation. This family includes the uncharacterized YgeY of Escherichia coli, and belongs to a larger family of metalloenzymes in which some are known peptidases, others enzymes of different types.

CC  Members of this protein family are about 200 amino acids in size, and include the uncharacterized YedF protein of Escherichia coli. This family shares an N-terminal domain, modeled by PF01206, with the sulfurtransferase TusA (also called SirA). The C-terminal domain includes a typical redox-active disulfide motif, CGXC. This protein family found only among those genomes that also carry the selenium donor protein SelD, and its connection to selenium metabolism is indicated by the method of partial phylogenetic profiling [1] vs. SelD. Its gene typically is found next to selD. Members of this family are found even when selenocysteine and selenouridine biosynthesis pathways are, except for SelD, completely absent, as in Enterococcus faecalis. Its role in selenium metabolism is unclear, but may include either detoxification or a role in labile selenoprotein biosynthesis.

CC  Coenzyme F420 differs between the Archaea and the Actinobacteria, where the numbers of glutamate residues attached are 2 (Archaea) or 5-6 (Mycobacterium). The enzyme in the Archaea is homologous to the N-terminal domain of FbiB from Mycobacterium bovis, and is responsible for glutamate ligation. Therefore it seems likely that the C-terminal domain of FbiB, modeled by this HMM, is involved in additional glutamate ligation.

CC  This family of proteins includes the characterized NeuD sialic acid O-acetyltransferase enzymes from E. coli and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B strep) [1, 2, 3].  These two are quite closely related to one another, so extension of this annotation to other members of the family in unsupported without additional independent evidence.  The neuD gene is often observed in close proximity to the neuABC genes for the biosynthesis of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-sialic acid), and NeuD sequences from these organisms were used to construct the seed for this model.  Nevertheless, there are numerous instances of sequences identified by this model which are observed in a different genomic context (although almost universally in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis-related loci), as well as in genomes for which the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA) is undemonstrated.  Even in the cases where the association with SA biosynthesis is strong, it is unclear in the literature whether the biological substrate is SA iteself, CMP-SA, or a polymer containing SA.  Similarly, it is unclear to what extent the enzyme has a preference for acetylation at the 7, 8 or 9 positions.  In the absence of evidence of association with SA, members of this family may be involved with the acetylation of differring sugar substrates, or possibly the delivery of alternative acyl groups.  The closest related sequences to this family (and those used to root the phylogenetic tree constructed to create this model) are believed to be succinyltransferases involved in lysine biosynthesis.
CC  These proteins contain repeats of the bacterial transferase hexapeptide (PF00132), although often these do not register above the trusted cutoff.

CC  This family is a distinct subgroup among members of the luciferase monooxygenase domain family. The larger family contains both FMN-binding enzymes (luciferase, alkane monooxygenase) and F420-binding enzymes (methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase, secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). Although some members of the domain family bind coenzyme F420 rather than FMN, members of this family are from species that lack the genes for F420 biosynthesis. A crystal structure, but not function, is known (but unpublished) for the member from Bacillus cereus, PDB|2B81.

CC  This clade of sequences is highly similar to the HisF protein, but generally represents the second HisF homolog in the genome where the other is an authentic HisF observed in the context of a complete histidine biosynthesis operon.  The similarity between these WbuZ sequences and true HisFs is such that often the closest match by BLAST of a WbuZ is a HisF.  Only by making a multiple sequence alignment is the homology relationship among the WbuZ sequences made apparent.  WbuZ genes are invariably observed in the presence of a homolog of the HisH protein (designated WbuY) and a proposed N-acetyl sugar amidotransferase designated in WbuX in E. coli [1], IfnA in P. aeriginosa [2] and PseA in C. jejuni [3].  Similarly, this trio of genes is invariably found in the context of saccharide biosynthesis loci.  It has been shown that the WbuYZ homologs are not essential components of the activity expressed by WbuX, leading to the proposal that these to proteins provide ammonium ions to the amidotransferase when these are in low concentration [1].  WbuY (like HisH) is proposed to act as a glutaminase to release ammonium.  In histidine biosynthesis this is also dispensible in the presence of exogenous ammonium ion.  HisH and HisF form a complex such that the ammonium ion is passed directly to HisF where it is used in an amidation reaction causing a subsequent cleavage and cyclization.  In the case of WbuYZ, the ammonium ion would be passed from WbuY to WbuZ.  WbuZ, being non-essential and so similar to HisF that a sugar substrate is unlikely, would function instead as a amoonium channel to the WbuX protein which does the enzymatic work.

CC  This enzyme has been implicated in the formation of the acetamido moiety (sugar-NC(=NH)CH3) which is found on some exopolysaccharides and is positively charged at neutral pH.  The reaction involves ligation of ammonia with a sugar N-acetyl group, displacing water.  In E. coli (O145 strain) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (O12 strain) this gene is known as wbuX and ifnA respectively and likely acts on sialic acid [1].  In Campylobacter jejuni, the gene is known as pseA and  acts on pseudaminic acid in the process of flagellin glycosylation [2].  In other Pseudomonas strains and various organisms it is unclear what the identity of the sugar substrate is, and in fact, the phylogenetic tree of this family sports a considerably deep branching suggestive of possible major differences in substrate structure.  Nevertheless, the family is characterized by a conserved tetracysteine motif (CxxC.....[GN]xCxxC) possibly indicative of a metal binding site, as well as an invariable contextual association with homologs of the HisH and HisF proteins known as WbuY and WbuZ, respectively.  These two proteins are believed to supply the enzyme with ammonium by hydrolysis of glutamine and delivery through an ammonium conduit [3].

Members of the TOMM class (thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins) are recognizable by association with cyclodehydratase (and often dehydrogenase) maturation proteins. This family consists of a special subclass, the heterocycloanthracin family, that share a homologous leader peptide region and then a repeat region with Cys as every third residue. In Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus, the RiPP (ribosomally translated and post-translationally modified natural product) precursor is encoded far from its maturase genes, and every strain has the system. In other species (e.g. B. licheniformis, B. sorenensis), precursor and maturase genes are close together. Sonorensin, from B. sonorensis MT93, was shown to have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, affecting Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Partial phylogenetic profiling identifies protein subfamilies, within the larger family called luciferase-like monooxygenanases (PF00296), that appear only in F420-positive genomes and are likely to be F420-dependent.

CC  A Genome Properties metabolic reconstruction for F420 biosynthesis shows that slightly over 10 percent of all prokaryotes with fully sequenced genomes, including about two thirds of the Actinomyces, make F420. The Partial Phylogenetic Profiling algorithm identifies this members of this protein family as high-scoring proteins to the F420 biosynthesis profile. A member of this family, Rv1155, was crytallized after expression in Escherichia coli, which does not synthesize F420; the crystal structure shown to resemble FMN-binding proteins, but with a recognizable empty cleft corresponding to, yet differing profounding from, the FMN site of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase. We propose that this protein family consists of F420-binding enzymes.

IsdC is believed to make a direct contact with, and transfer heme to, the heme-binding component (IsdE) of an ABC transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane, and to receive heme from other NEAT-containing heme-binding proteins also localized in the cell wall.

CC  HarA is a heme-binding NEAT-domain (NEAr Transporter, PF05031) protein which has been shown to bind to the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex in order to extract heme from it.  HarA has also been reported to bind hemoglobin directly [2].  HarA (also known as IsdH) contains three NEAT domains as well as a sortase A C-terminal signal for localization to the cell wall.  The heme bound at the third of these NEAT domains has been shown to be transferred to the IsdA protein also localized at the cell wall, presumably through an additional specific protein-protein interaction [3].  Haptoglobin is a hemoglobin carrier protein involved in scavenging hemoglobin in the blood following red blood cell lysis and targetting it to the liver.

All members of this protein family known during model construction end with the C-terminal motif [FY][VI]QKGG[QE]. Ligation is thought to occur between the C-terminal COOH of Pup and an epsilon-amino group of a Lys on the target protein. The N-terminal half of this protein is poorly conserved and not represented in the seed alignment.

CC  This model represents a conserved unique core sequence shared by large numbers of proteins. It is occasional in the Archaea Methanosarcina barkeri) but common in bacteria and eukaryotes. Most fall into two large classes. One class consists of long proteins in which two classes of repeats are abundant: an FG-GAP repeat (PF01839) class, and an RHS repeat (PF05593) or YD repeat (TIGR01643). This class includes secreted bacterial insecticidal toxins and intercellular signalling proteins such as the teneurins in animals. The other class consists of uncharacterized proteins shorter than 400 amino acids, where this core domain of about 75 amino acids tends to occur in the N-terminal half. Over twenty such proteins are found in Pseudomonas putida alone; little sequence similarity or repeat structure is found among these proteins outside the region modeled by this domain.

Members of the seed alignment use to define this exception-level model are encoded adjacent to a polyphosphate kinase 1 gene, and the trusted cutoff is set high enough (425) that no genome has a second hit. Therefore all members may be presumed to at least share exopolyphospatase activity, and may lack GppA activity. GppA acts in the stringent response.

CC  This family of proteins contains a C-terminal thiamine diphosphate (TPP) binding domain typical of flavodoxin/ferredoxin oxidoreductases (PF01855) as well as an N-terminal domain similar to the gamma subunit of the same group of oxidoreductases (PF01558).  The genes represented by this model are always found in association with a neighboring gene for a beta subunit (TIGR02177) which also occurs in a 4-subunit (alpha/beta/gamma/ferredoxin) version of the system.  This alpha/gamma plus beta structure was used to define the set of sequences to include in this model.  
CC  This pair of genes is not consistantly observed in proximity to any electron acceptor genes, but is found next to putative ferredoxins or ferredoxin-domain proteins in Azoarcus sp. EbN1, Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110, Frankia sp. CcI3, Rhodoferax ferrireducens DSM 15236, Rhodopseudomonas palustris BisB5, Os, Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 and Streptomyces clavuligerus.  Other potential acceptors are also sporadically observed in close proximity including ferritin-like proteins, reberythrin, peroxiredoxin and a variety of other flavin and iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins.
CC  The phylogenetic distribution of this family encompasses archaea, a number of deeply-branching bacterial clades and only a small number of firmicutes and proteobacteria. 
CC  The enzyme from Sulfolobus has been characterized with respect to its substrate specificity [1] which is described as wide, encompassing various 2-oxoacids such as 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxobutyrate and pyruvate.  The enzyme from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus has been shown to have a high specificity towards 2-oxoglutarate [2,3] and is one of the key enzymes in the reverse TCA cycle in this organism.  Furthermore, considering its binding of coenzyme A, it can be reasonably inferred that the product of the reaction is succinyl-CoA.  
CC  The genes for this enzyme in Prevotella intermedia 17, Persephonella marina EX-H1 and Picrophilus torridus DSM 9790 are in close proximity to a variety of TCA cycle genes.  Persephonella marina and P. torridus [4] are believed to encode complete TCA cycles, and none of these contains the lipoate-based 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1/E2/E3) system.  That system is presumed to be replaced by this one.  In fact, the lipoate system is absent in most organisms possessing a member of this family, providing additional circumstantial evidence that many of these enzymes are capable of acting as 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases and

The pair, which appears universal in the archaea, corresponds to EKC/KEOPS complex in eukaryotes. A recent characterization of the member from Pyrococcus abyssi, as an iron-binding, atypical DNA-binding protein with an apurinic lyase activity, challenges the common annotation of close homologs as O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase. The latter annotation is based on a characterized protein from the bacterium Pasteurella haemolytica.

CC  This model represents bacterial members of a protein family that is widely distributed. In a few pathogenic species, the protein is exported in a way that may represent an exceptional secondary function. This model plus companion (archaeal) model TIGR03722 together span the prokaryotic member sequences of TIGR00329, a protein family that appears universal in life, and whose broad function is unknown. A member of TIGR03722 has been characterized as a DNA-binding protein with apurinic endopeptidase activity. In contrast, the rare characterized members of the present family show O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (EC. 3.4.24.57) activity after export. These include glycoprotease (gcp) from Pasteurella haemolytica A1 and a cohemolysin from Riemerella anatipestifer (GB|AAG39646.1). The member from Staphylococcus aureus is essential and is related to cell wall dynamics and the modulation of autolysis, but members are also found in the Mycoplasmas (which lack a cell wall). A reasonable hypothesis is that virulence-related activities after export are secondary to a bacterial domain-wide unknown function.

A member of the family from a pathogenicity island in Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin strain was designated PilL for nomenclature consistency with a neighboring gene for the pilin structural protein PilS. However, the species distribution of this protein family tracks much better with markers of conjugal transfer than with markers of PilS-like pilin structure.

It co-occurs with a variant sortase enzyme (TIGR03784), usually in the same gene neighborhood, in proteobacterial species most of which are marine, and with an LPXTG motif-containing sortase target conserved protein (TIGR03788). Sortases and LPXTG proteins are far more common in Gram-positive bacteria, where sortase systems mediate attachment to the cell wall or cross-linking of pilin structures. We give this predicted sensor histidine kinase the gene symbol psdS, for Proteobacterial Dedicated Sortase system Sensor histidine kinase.

CC  This HMM describes a domain that occurs once in the major pilin of Streptococcus pyogenes, Spy0128, but in higher copy numbers in other streptococcal proteins. The domain occurs nine times in a surface-anchored protein of Bifidobacterium longum. All members of this family have LPXTG-type sortase target sequences. The S. pyogenes major pilin has been shown to undergo isopeptide bond cross-linking, mediated by sortases, that are critical to maintaining pilus structural integrity. One such Lys-to-Asn isopeptide bond is to a near-invariant Asn near the C-terminal end of this domain (column 81 of the seed alignment). A Glu in the S. pyogenes  major pilin (column 25 of the seed alignment), invariant as Glu or Gln, is described as catalytic for isopeptide bond formation.

CC  This HMM represents a domain that is conserved among a large number of putative ribosomal natural products (RNP) precursor, including the thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins (TOMMs). As a leader peptide domain, likely to be removed from the mature product, this domain is unusual in several ways. First, it is longer than most previously described RNP leader peptides. Second, most of the domain is homologous to nitrile hydratase alpha subunits. Finally, it appears that this domain correlates with a specific family of cleavage/export proteins while members undergo modifications by different classes of peptide maturase, including cyclodehydratases, lantibiotic synthases, radical SAM peptide maturases. This family is expanded especially in Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum SI.

CC  This enzyme is proposed here to be a form of aspartate 1-decarboxylase, pyridoxal-dependent, that represents a non-orthologous displacement to the more widely distributed pyruvoyl-dependent form (TIGR00223).  Aspartate 1-decarboxylase makes beta-alanine, used usually in pathothenate biosynthesis, by decarboxylation from asparatate. A number of species with the PanB and PanC enzymes, however, lack PanD. This protein family occurs in a number of Proteobacteria that lack PanD. This enzyme family appears to be a pyridoxal-dependent enzyme (see PF00282). The family was identified by Partial Phylogenetic Profiling; members in Geobacter sulfurreducens, G. metallireducens, and Pseudoalteromonas atlantica are clustered with the genes for PanB and PanC. We suggest the gene symbol panP (panthothenate biosynthesis enzyme, Pyridoxal-dependent).

CC  This family describes the enzyme glutaminase, from a larger family that includes serine-dependent beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins. Many bacteria have two isozymes. This model is based on selected known glutaminases and their homologs within prokaryotes, with the exclusion of highly-derived (long branch) and architecturally varied homologs, so as to achieve conservative assignments. A sharp drop in scores occurs below 250, and cutoffs are set accordingly. The enzyme converts glutamine to glutamate, with the release of ammonia. Members tend to be described as glutaminase A (glsA), where B (glsB) is unknown and may not be homologous (as in Rhizobium etli). Some species have two isozymes that may both be designated A (GlsA1 and GlsA2).

All members of this family are from species that produce coenzyme F420; SIMBAL analysis suggests that members of this family bind F420 rather than FMN.

CC  This HMM represents a family of putative F420-dependent oxidoreductases, fairly closely related to 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer, TIGR03555), both within the bacterial luciferase-like monoxygenase (LLM) family. A fairly deep split (to about 40 % sequence identity) in the present family separates a strictly Actinobacterial clade from an alpha/beta/gamma-proteobacterial clade, in which the member is often the only apparent F420-dependent LLM family member. The specific function, and whether Actinobacterial and Proteobacterial clades differ in function, are unknown.

CC  This small clade of ABC-type transporter periplasmic binding protein components is found as a three gene cassette along with a permease (TIGR03869) and an ATPase (TIGR03873).  The organisms containing this cassette are all Actinobacteria and all contain numerous genes requiring the coenzyme F420.  This model was defined based on five such organisms, four of which are lacking all F420 biosynthetic capability save the final side-chain polyglutamate attachment step (via the gene cofE: TIGR01916).  In Jonesia denitrificans DSM 20603 and marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1 this cassette is in an apparent operon with the cofE gene and, in PHSC20C1, also with a F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (TIGR03554).  Based on these observations we propose that this periplasmic binding protein is a component of an F420-0 (that is, F420 lacking only the polyglutamate tail) transporter.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  his small clade of ABC-type transporter permease protein components is found as a three gene cassette along with a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (TIGR03868) and an ATPase (TIGR03873).  The organisms containing this cassette are all Actinobacteria and all contain numerous genes requiring the coenzyme F420.  This model was defined based on five such organisms, four of which are lacking all F420 biosynthetic capability save the final side-chain polyglutamate attachment step (via the gene cofE: TIGR01916).  In Jonesia denitrificans DSM 20603 and marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1 this cassette is in an apparent operon with the cofE gene and, in PHSC20C1, also with an F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (TIGR03554).  Based on these observations we propose that this permease protein is a component of a F420-0 (that is, F420 lacking only the polyglutamate tail) transporter.

EN  methanol oxidation system protein MoxJ
GS  moxJ
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This predicted periplasmic protein, called MoxJ or MxaJ, is required for methanol oxidation in Methylobacterium extorquens. Two differing lines of evidence suggest two different roles. Forming one view, homology suggests it is the substrate-binding protein of an ABC transporter associated with methanol oxidation. The gene, furthermore, is found regular in genomes with, and only two or three genes away from, a corresponding permease and ATP-binding cassette gene pair. The other view is that this protein is an accessory factor or additional subunit of methanol dehydrogenase itself. Mutational studies show a dependence on this protein for expression of the PQQ-dependent, two-subunit methanol dehydrogenase (MxaF and MxaI) in Methylobacterium extorquens, as if it is a chaperone for enzyme assembly or a third subunit. A homologous N-terminal sequence was found in Paracoccus denitrificans as a 32Kd third subunit. This protein may, in fact, be both, a component of a periplasmic enzyme that converts methanol to formaldehyde and a component of an ABC transporter that delivers the resulting formaldehyde to the cell's interior.

CC  This protein family, a sister family to TIGR03870, is found more broadly. It occurs a range of PQQ-biosynthesizing species, not just in known methanotrophs. Interpretation of evidence by homology and by direct experimental work suggest two different roles. By homology, this family appears to be the periplasmic substrate-binding protein of an ABC transport family.  However, mutational studies and direct characterization for some sequences related to this family suggests this family may act as a maturation chaperone or additional subunit of a methanol dehydrogenase-like enzyme.

CC  Members of this protein family are conserved hypothetical proteins with a limited species distribution within the Gammaproteobacteria. It is common in the genera Vibrio and Shewanella, and in this resembles the C-terminal domain and putative protein sorting motif TIGR03501. This model, but design, does not extend to all homologs,but rather represents a particular clade.

CC  This model describes a multidomain protein of about 1070 residues, restricted to the order Myxococcales in the Deltaproteobacteria. Members contain a PDZ domain (PF00595), an S41 family peptidase domain (PF03572), and an SH3 domain (PF06347). A core region of this family, including PDZ and S41 regions, is described by TIGR00225, C-terminal processing peptidase, which recognizes the Prc protease. The species distribution of this family approximates that of largely Deltaproteobacterial C-terminal putative protein-sorting domain, TIGR03901, analogous to LPXTG and PEP-CTERM, but the co-occurrence may reflect shared restriction to the Myxococcales rather than a substrate/target relationship.

It is restricted to the Myxococcales, a division of the Deltaproteobacteria, with over 60 members occurring in Plesiocystis pacifica SIR-1. An example protein is TraA, involved in outer membrane exchange (lipids and proteins) through which one strain of Myxococcus can repair a mobility defect in another. The trusted cutoff for this model is set artificially high to avoid false positives, and consequently only about half of all members are recognized.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This narrowly distributed protein family contains an N-terminal radical SAM domain. It occurs in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, Ralstonia solanacearum, and numerous species and strains of Burkholderia. Members always occur next to a trio of three mutually homologous genes, all of which contain the domain PF08898 as the whole of the protein (about 60 amino acids) or as the C-terminal domain. The function is unknown, but the fact that all phylogenetically correlated proteins are mutually homologous with prominent invariant motifs (an invariant tyrosine and a GDL motif) and as small as 60 amino acids suggests that post-translational modification of PF08898 domain-containing proteins may be its function. This view is supported by closer homology to the PqqE radical SAM protein involved in PQQ biosynthesis from the PqqA precursor peptide than to other characterized radical SAM proteins.

About forty percent of the members of this family occur as fusion proteins, where the C-terminal domain belongs to the uracil-DNA glycosylase family, a DNA repair family (because uracil in DNA is deamidated cytosine). The linkage by gene clustering and correlated species distribution to a radical SAM protein, and by gene fusion to a DNA repair protein family, suggests a role in DNA modification and/or repair.

CC  This uncharacterized protein of about 400 amino acids in length contains a radical SAM protein in the N-terminal half.

Roughly forty percent of the members of that family exist as fusions with a uracil-DNA glycosylase-like region, TIGR03914. In DNA, uracil results from deamidation of cytosine, forming U/G mismatches that lead to mutation, and so uracil-DNA glycosylase is a DNA repair enzyme. This indirect connection, and the recurring role or radical SAM protein in modification chemistries, suggest that this protein may act in DNA modification, repair, or both.

CC  Families TIGR03969 and TIGR03962 describe, respectively, the putative mycofactocin precursor and its cognate radical SAM peptide maturase. This small protein family appears in the same sporadically distributed cassette and may serve as a scaffolding protein during mycofactocin maturation or as a carrier protein for the mature product, a putative novel redox carrier. A feature of mycofactocin-encoding genomes is co-clustering with sets of NAD-binding oxidoreductases in which the NAD is not exchangeable. Therefore it is proposed that mature mycofactocin, bound by a member of this family as a carrier protein, docks with the nicotinoprotein to allow electron transfer. Mediation of electron transfer through this system would define a segregated redox pool.

The other is occurrence only in a five gene context in which two members are radical SAM proteins (TIGR03977 and TIGR03978) also likely involved in post-translational modification.

CC  The MMP1680 protein from Methanococcus maripaludis has been characterized as the archaeal protein responsible for the second step of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis [1].  This GlmM protein catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate.  The first-characterized bacterial GlmM protein is modeled by TIGR01455.  These two families are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterized by three domains: PF02878, PF02879 and PF02880), but are not nearest neighbors to each other.
CC  This model also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages.  Evidence supporting their inclusion in this equivalog as having the same activity comes from genomic context and phylogenetic profiling.  A large number of these organisms are known to produce exo-polysaccharide and yet only appeared to contain the GlmS enzyme of the GlmSMU pathway for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (GenProp0750).  In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homolog.  Phylogenetic profiling of the GlmS-only pattern using PPP [2] identifies members of this archaeal GlmM family as the highest-scoring result.

Homologs of this enzyme are identified in a number of bacterial organisms and modeled here.  A number of these are observed in proximity to the GlmS and GlmM genes, and phylogenetic profiling by PPP [2] identifies the LEPBI_I0518 gene in Leptospira biflexa as a likely Glm-system candidate.  Multiple sequence alignments of these bacterial homologs with their archaeal counterparts reveals significant structural differences, necessitating the construction of separate models.

At least one member, RF|YP_001509627.1 from Frankia sp. EAN1pec, is fused to the LLM protein. The function of these gene pairs is unknown.

CC  Members of this family are radical SAM proteins found in about 5 percent of microbial genomes. A portion occur as gene fusions with, or adjacent to, members of the TatD family of hydrolases (PF01026). The TatD family may have several paralogs per genome, including TatD itself from E. coli (a soluble protein not actually part of the twin-arginine translocation complex), which appears to act in quality control for TAT, directing turnover of misfolded TAT substrates. The functions of TatD family hydrolases in general (other than TatD itself, which may be exceptional within its larger family), and of this radical SAM domain protein modeled here, are unknown.

Published descriptions of members of this family are available for RagA from Porphyromonas gingivalis, SusC from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and OmpW from Bacteroides caccae. Members form pairs with members of the SusD/RagB family (PF07980).

This enzyme performs end-healing reactions on broken RNA, preparing from the RNA ligase to close the break. The working hypothesis is that the combination of Pnkp (RNA repair) and Hen1 (RNA modification) serves to first repair RNA damage from ribotoxins and then perform a modification that prevents the damage from recurring.

CRISPR systems belong to different subtypes, distinguished by both nature of the repeats, the makeup of the cohort of associated Cas proteins, and by molecular phylogeny within the more universal Cas proteins such as this one. This model is of type EXCEPTION and provides more specific information than the EQUIVALOG model TIGR00287. It describes a clade of Cas1 limited to the CYANO subtype of CRISPR/Cas system and most often the type found there.

CC  Bacteria whose genomes encode only one protein with the YSIRK variant form of signal peptide (TIGR01168) were examined for conserved genes near that one tagged protein. This protein is found adjacent to at various classes of repetitive or low-complexity YSIRK proteins (whether unique in genome or not), in a range of species (Enterococcus faecalis X98, Ruminococcus torques, Coprobacillus sp. D7, Lysinibacillus fusiformis ZC1, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi 4047, etc). The affliated YSIRK proteins include Streptococcal protective antigen (see PMID:19865839) and proteins with the Rib/alpha/Esp surface antigen repeat (see TIGR02331). The last quarter of this protein has an AraC family helix-turn-helix (HTH)transcriptional regulator domain.

CC  The FnlA enzyme is the first step in the biosynthesis of UDP-FucNAc from UDP-GlcNAc in E. coli (along with FnlB and FnlC).  The proteins identified by this model include FnlA homologs in the O-antigen clusters of O4, O25, O26, O29 (Shigella D11), O118, O145 and O172 serotype strains, all of which produce O-antigens containing FucNAc (or the further modified FucNAm).  A homolog from Pseudomonas aerugiosa serotype O11, WbjB, also involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-FucNAc has been characterized and is now believed to carry out both the initial 4,6-dehydratase reaction and the subsequent epimerization of the resulting methyl group at C-5 [1].  A phylogenetic tree of related sequences shows a distinct clade of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-QuiNAc (Qui=qinovosamine). This clade appears to be descendant from the common ancestor of the Pseudomonas and E. coli fucose-biosynthesis enzymes.  It has been hypothesized [2] that the first step in the biosynthesis of these two compounds may be the same, and thus that these enzymes all have the same function.  At present, lacking sufficient confirmation of this, the current model trusted cutoff only covers the tree segment surrounding the E. coli genes.  The clades containing the Pseudomonas and QuiNAc biosynthesis enzymes score above the noise cutoff.  Immediately below the noise cutoff are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-RhaNAc (Rha=rhamnose), which again may or may not produce the same product.

Surprisingly, members of this family show full-length homology to each other, with several scoring at least borderline hits to both PF04055 and TIGR04085, and yet differ in the presence/absence of a signature CX(3)CX(2)CX(9)C motif. Instead, members are best-conserved in the TIGR04085-like C-terminal region. Therefore, this protein family is designated a pseudo-radical-SAM protein, which likely works in partnership with a TIGR04148 family protein.

These seven genes form the core of the cassette, although they are often accompanied by additional genes that may further modify the product sugar. Although this cassette is widely distributed in bacteria, the family nomenclature arises from the instance in Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai, str. 56601, where it appears as the 30th gene in the 91-gene lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster.

Because of this conserved gene neighborhood and close sequence similarity to ATP-grasp enzymes from microviridin/marinostatin biosynthesis cassettes, this enzyme is suggested also to serve as a peptide maturase.

CC  This protein family is one of several observed in species that express bacillithiol, an analog of glutathione and mycothiol. Rather than being involved in bacillithiol biosynthesis, members are likely to act in bacillithiol-dependent processes. A suggested term is bacilliredoxin (a glutaredoxin-like thiol-dependent oxidoreductase), and a suggested role of YphP is de-bacillithiolation - removing bacillithiol that became linked to protein thiols under oxidative stress. An older description of YphP as a disulphide isomerase therefore may be wrong.

CC  Members of this protein family are precursors of TOMMs, that is, thizazole/oxazole-modified microcins. Members are about 42 residues in length, have a C-terminal region of extremely low complexity rich in Ser, and are often missed by ab initio gene callers. The plantazolicin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a peptide antibiotic effective against Bacillus anthracis.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this protein family are small (~ 80 amino acids) and occur in biosynthesis clusters for cyanobactins, a type of ribosomal natural product, thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM). The function of this protein family is unknown, and the recognized cyanobactin precursors (e.g. microcyclamides and patellamides) are encoded by a different protein (see TIGR03678). In this protein family, however, a core region of about 62 amino acids (modeled) is followed by a hypervariable region of 5 to 23 amino acids, with hallmarks of possible cyclodehydratase modification sites. The hallmarks include Cys residues flanked by Gly, and variable length Ser-rich tripeptide repeats. Further, members of this family were shown dispensible for patellamide biosynthesis, and two may occur in a cluster. Therefore, this family may represent a precursor of another type of ribosomal natural product.

This model represents the homology domain family of the D2 domain. It occurs just once in many surface proteins but up to twenty times in some pilin subunit proteins. Three of every four members have the typical Gram-positive C-terminal motif, LPXTG, although in many cases this motif may be involved in pilin subunit cross-linking rather than cell wall attachment. Proteins with this domain include fimbrial proteins with lectin-like adhesion functions, and the majority of characterized members are involved in surface adhesion to host structures.

CC  GlpG in E. coli is a rhomboid family intramembrane serine protease that has been extensively characterized as a proxy for rhomboid family proteases in animals. It efficiently cleaves eukaryote-derived model substrates. This multiple membrane-spanning protein excludes inappropriate substrates from access to its cleavage site, and shows activity against truncated versions, but not full-length versions, of the E. coli multidrug transporter MdfA. This finding suggests a housekeeping function in removing faulty proteins. In contrast, several eukaryotic rhomboid family proteases release peptide hormones for signaling functions, and the Shewanella and Vibrio protein rhombosortase appears to be part of a protein-sorting system, cleaving a C-terminal anchoring helix domain.

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  This HMM describes a family of radical SAM/SPASM enzymes largely from the deltaproteobacteria. The family is most closely related to radical SAM enzyme family regularly in archaea in the vicinity of tungsten-containing oxidoreductases. A single member of the family in archaea may correspond to multiple tungsten enzymes, e.g. five in Pyrococcus furiosus. Therefore, the lack of a conserved gene neighborhood for members of this family in deltaprotebacteria suggests members may be involved in the maturation of multiple metalloenzymes.

CC  This domain, about 385 amino acids long, can have either of at least two types of C-terminal sorting signal. Members from Shewanella and allies have the rhombosortase target domain GlyGly-CTERM (TIGR03501), while members of the Bacteroidetes have the Por secretion system C-terminal domain (TIGR04183). Most other members lack any C-terminal extension, but in most of those, the normal signal sequence is replaced by a lipoprotein signal sequence. Member sequences show a region of local similarity to the LVIVD repeat sequence (PF08309).

TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are absolutely restricted to the Mollicutes (Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma). All have a signal peptide, usually of the lipoprotein type, suggesting surface expression. Most members have lengths of about 280 residues but some members have a nearly full-length duplication. The mostly nearly invariant residue, a Trp,is part of a strongly conserved 9-residue motif, [ND]-W-[LY]-[WF]-X-[LF]-X-N-[LI], where X usually is hydrophobic. Because the hydrophobic six-residue core of this motif almost always contains three to four aromatic residues, we name this family aromatic cluster surface protein. Multiple paralogs may occur in a given Mycoplasma, usually clustered on the genome.

CC  In at least ten species of Lactobacillus, this close homolog to known ornithine decarboxylase occurs in a three-gene neighborhood, along with an amino acid permease family transporter and pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enyzme from the cystathionine gamma-lyase family. Species include L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii, L. farciminis, L. helveticus, L. johnsonii, etc. The combination of a decarboxylase with an antiporter in a two-gene system suggests a decarboxylation/antiport proton-motive cycle for transient resistance to acidic conditions. The substrate for this decarboxylase might be ornithine but is unknown.

The tetracycline resistance plasmid pCF10 in Enterococcus faecalis promotes conjugal plasmid transfer in response to sex pheromones, but PgrA/Sec10 encoded by that plasmid, a member of this family, specifically inhibits the ability of cells to receive homologous plasmids. The phenomenon is called surface exclusion.

CC  This three-domain protein is restricted to the spirochetes and widely distributed (excepting Borrelia). It has a conserved C-terminal SPASM domain, a 4Fe-4S binding domain shared by a number of peptide-modifying and heme-modifying radical SAM proteins. It has a central radical SAM domain, although half the members have lost the signature 4Fe-4S-binding Cys residues, fail to register with the radical SAM domain definition of Pfam model PF04055, and must be considered pseudo-SAM proteins. PSI-BLAST shows a relationship between the N-terminal domain and various predicted glycosyltransferases (e.g. Bacillus subtilis SpsF) and cytidyltransferases. In some Treponema species, this protein appears to split into two tandem genes.

CC  Ovothiol A is N1-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine. In the absence of S-adenosylmethione, a methyl donor, the intermediate produced is 4-mercaptohistidine. In both Erwinia tasmaniensis and Trypanosoma cruzi, a protein occurs with 5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide synthase activity, but these two enzymes and most homologs share an additional C-terminal methyltransferase domain. Thus OvoA may be a bifunctional enzyme with 5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide synthase and 4-mercaptohistidine N1-methyltranferase activity. This model describes the 5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide synthase domain, a homolog of the ergothioneine biosynthesis protein EgtB.

A majority of rSAM/SPASM proteins modify ribosomally produced peptides.

We suggest the name amphi-Trp for this domain.

Members of this family include TrbK of the Ti plasmid from Agrobacterium, shown not to be required for transfer, which would be consistent with a role in entry exclusion rather than transfer itself. Li et al. (PMID:10438776) cite unpublished results that showed an entry exclusion function for TrbK of the Ti plasmid. This small protein shares close C-terminal sequence homology to the much longer protein encoded by the neighboring gene TrbJ.

CC  Members of this family are the alpha (large) subunit of the alpha-2/beta-2 tetrameric enzyme that reactivates B12-dependent trimeric diol dehydratases (1,2-propanediol dehydratase, glycerol dehydratase). Note that the beta subunit of the reactivase is homologous to the beta (medium) subunit of the diol dehydratase. The reactivase catalyzes the exchange of chemically inactivated B-12 for active B12. This model excludes homologs from Mycobacterium (e.g. M. smegmatis), where the several paralogous forms of the dehydratase occur and are exceptional also by not being found in a carboxysome-like microcompartment.

CC  Following the action of a flavin-dependent L-amino acid oxidase that converts L-tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvate imine, the enzymes VioB (this family), RebD, and StaD can ligate two molecules, forming a coupled iminophenyl-pyruvate dimer. In the violacein biosynthesis pathway, this compound is acted on by VioE before it cyclizes spontaneously to chromopyrrolic acid. In the pathways of homolog StaD (staurosporine), chromopyrrolate is formed, and the enzyme is referred to as chromopyrrolate synthase. RebD is very similar to StaD, but acts on chlorinated Trp-derived molecules.

CC  This family of proteins is restricted to the Mollicutes (including Mycoplasma, Spiroplasma, and Ureaplasma). Members belong to a superfamily of multiple membrane-spanning proteins, among which those with assigned activities function as the S component (the specificity component) of ECF transporters. However, members fail to score better than the trusted cutoffs to previously built models for S component proteins (see Pfam family PF07155).

The crystal structure of the protein M antibody-binding region is solved (PDB|4NZR), and includes this homology domain. Full-length homologs to MG_281 are known in a few other Mycoplasma species, but this model's seed alignment demonstrates distant homology to many additional proteins with a much wider distribution across the Mollicutes. Member proteins include paralogous families in some species, such as MCAP_0345, MCAP_0347, MCAP_0349, and MCAP_0351 in Mycoplasma capricolum.

The best characterized member, Rv0203, is a hemophore, that is, a secreted polypeptide that binds heme and delivers it to a transport system for import. Hemophores are protein analogs of siderophores, natural products that chelate non-heme iron and deliver it to receptors for transport. The unrelated HasA family of hemophores has been described in Gram-negative bacteria such as Yersinia pestis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

One is the family of enzymes that includes Dyp-type peroxidases. The other is this family, with a resemblance to bacterioferritins. Encapsulin-associated forms of the proteins in these two families have a necessary C-terminal motif that resembles DGSL[SGN]IGSL[KR]. Members of this family that include the last columns of the HMM in the hit region (and are encoded next to the encapsulin gene) should be designated encapsulin-associated ferritin-like protein.

CC  Members of this family are lipoproteins with the typical zinc metallohydrolase HExxH motif and additional similarities to a better-documented zinc peptidase family, PF06167. The seed alignment begins immediately after the lipoprotein motif Cys residue. Up to five members of this protein family occur per genome, in the context of certain gene pairs related to RagA and RagB, or to SusC and SusD. Those gene pairs, like the present family, are restricted to the Bacteriodetes, may number up to 100 pairs per genome, and are linked to TonB-dependent uptake of biopolymer-derived nutrients such as glycans. A possible function for this lipoprotein is to hydrolyse larger molecules to prepare substrates for import and utilization.

The most closely related homologs outside the Myxococcales show localized homology only and display sharply lower scores. Relatively few protein families (roughly 20) could be built to have a comparable restriction to the Myxococcales. The putative protein sorting signal MYXO-CTERM (TIGR03901) appears so far universal in but restricted to the Myxococcales, making the present family a candidate to be involved in recognizing and processing proteins with that signal.

CC  This HMM identifies a C-terminal domain of about 27 residues whose features are 1) a short Gly/Ser-rich region that ends in an invariant Gly-Cys motif, 2) a highly hydrophobic probable transmembrane alpha helix with a nearly invariant Pro near the end, and 3) a cluster of basic residues (Arg, Lys), and then the end of the protein. This domain occurs, so far, only in species of Synergistetes (Dethiosulfovibrio peptidovorans, Aminiphilus circumscriptus, Aminomonas paucivorans, Fretibacterium fastidiosum, Cloacibacillus evryensis, Synergistes jonesii, etc). This region closely resembles the MXYO-CTERM region of the Myxococcales, a division of the Deltaproteobacteria (see TIGR03901), but that domain lacks the the conserved Pro, frequently has two Cys residues instead of one, and most importantly, has a spacer region separating the Gly-Cys motif from the transmembrane segment. As with MYXO-CTERM, the enzyme presumed to recognize and cleave the sorting signal is not known. The lack of a spacer region between motif and TM segment suggests the presumed protease is located largely within the membrane, like rhombosortase and archaeosortase, rather than merely tethered to it like sortase.
